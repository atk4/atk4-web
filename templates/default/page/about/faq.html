<h5>Q: I have an idea for a new web software application. Can I use the Agile Toolkit in my project?</h5>
<p>Of course. You can download the open-source version of the Agile Toolkit and start using it straight away. The features of the open-source version are identical to the Commercial version. If you are releasing a commercial application, you should consider purchasing the Commercial License so that you have no obligations to the Agile Toolkit Open-Source Community.</p>

<h5>Q: What are my obligations as a developer if I use the Open-Source version of Agile Toolkit?</h5>
<p>You must provide source code of your web project to the Agile Toolkit Open-Source Community.</p>

<h5>Q: I know about General Public License, but haven't heard about Affero General Public License. What's the difference?</h5>
<p>AGPL is ideologically identical to GPL. GPL is designed for server and desktop software, AGPL is more suited for on-line software. GPL requires the binary distribution of software to be accompanied with source code. AGPL requires websites using software to provide a download link.</p>

<h5>Q: I wish to use a different license for my project.</h5>
<p>If you are using the Open-Source version of the AgileToolkit, you can distribute your project under the AGPL license. With a Commercial version, you can attach your own software license.</p>

<h5>Q: I am using Open-Source Agile Toolkit. I am looking for investment, but investors want to protect intellectual property. What should I do?</h5>
<p>You should switch to the commercial version of Agile Toolkit. It is 100% compatible. After you switch, you can discontinue your open-source repository or remove the source code download link.</p>

<h5>Q: I would like to make an add-on for the Agile Toolkit. How does it work?</h5>
<p> You can develop your add-on using the Open-Source license or the Commercial license. With the Open-source license the project would be freely available to the Agile Toolkit community. With the Commercial license, you can sell the add-on commercially. If you would like your add-on to be available both to the Open_Source and Commercial community you can dual license it. You can do not need to have a Commercial license to dual license your add-on.</p>

<h5>Q: I am not interested in money. I want anyone to be able to use my add-on</h5>
<p>You can dual license your add-on under GPL and BSD (like jQuery does). In this case it can be freely used by both commercial and open source projects.</p>

<h5>Q: I have a contribution to Agile Toolkit. Who will hold copyrights on that?</h5>
<p>The Agile Toolkit is an intellectual property of Agile Technologies Limited. If your contributed code would also become property of Agile Toolkit in order to keep single ownership of the whole toolkit. We will always make your contribution available for both Open-source and commercial community. If you wish to retain ownership of your contribution, you can develop and publish an Extension for the Agile Toolkit.</p>

<h5>Q: What are the terms on commercial license</h5>
<p>The Commercial license allows a single developer to work on commercial project using Agile Toolkit for one year. At the end of the year if you wish to continue project development you must renew the license. The software you create does not have any restrictions on and does not require any license to operate.</p>

<h5>Q: Will I need to open-source project if I don't renew my license</h5>
<p>You would only need to Open-source your project if you continue development work on your project without the Commercial license.</p>

<h5>Q: How does Software as a Service (SaaS) work with open-source model?</h5>
<p>The Open-source license does not prevent you from charging for use of the software service. Many Software-as-a-Service sites rely on open-source software. The majority of your users would still prefer to use a maintained hosted version of the software regardless of availability of source code. The existence of an open-source project can also often help to promote your service. For a successful story of this model, refer to WordPress.com.</p>

<h5>Q: Other frameworks are using BSD license. Why don't you?</h5>
<p> The main reason is because the BSD license does not help to promote the Open-Source movement.</p>

<h5>Q: I am making software for a client who does not wish to have any license/payment obligations</h5>
<p>Agile Toolkit commercial license only applies on development work. If your client is running software, he can do so to any extent without paying anything. You however do need to be licensed. By holding an active license, you would also be in a good position to carry out additional work in the future.</p>

<h5>Q: I have developed commercial software using ATK4. How many servers it can run on?</h5>
<p>There are no limitation on number of servers, CPUs or number of users you have for your software</p>

<h5>Q: Which version of the Agile Toolkit am I using?</h5>
<p>Check http://yoursite.com/license.html, or look into header of any php files inside atk4 directory.</p>


<h5>Q: Is license fees refundable?</h5>
<p>No. However as a licensed developer you can work on as many projects as you wish</p>

<h5>Q: I like Agile Toolkit and I am willing to use it on my workplace</h5>
<p>Great. We created a page which summarizes business benefits of using Agile Toolkit. Pass this link to your boss: ...</p>

<h5>Q: I have existing web project with is under license X and I wish to use some features of Agile Toolkit</h5>
<p>It is possible to use Agile Toolkit in collaboration with another framework. Please consult terms of <a href="/license">Affero General Public License</a> for further questions on license compatibility</p>
