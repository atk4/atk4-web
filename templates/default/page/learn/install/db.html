        <h1>Database</h1>
        <p>Agile Toolkit relies on PHP/PDO to access database. As a result, multiple data-base vendors are supported, however
        they may vary in slight details. If your database is not supported, consider writing a simple driver, which will help
        Agile Toolkit generate certain types of queries. Luckily you already have drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite to
        look for. If you do develop your own driver, consider contributing it back to Agile Toolkit or make it available through
        an add-on.</p>

        <h2>Configuring access</h2>
        <p>The definition of the format of an SQL connection string goes back to the old days of year 2000 and is based on the 
        PEAR::DB format of DSN. Here is a typical connection string - which is normally placed inside your config.php:</p>
<?Code?>
$config['dsn']='mysql://user:password@localhost/dbname';

// define port:
// $config['dsn']='mysql://user:password:8888@localhost/dbname';

// through socket
// $config['dsn']='mysql://user:password:/tmp/sock@localhost/dbname';

<?/Code?>

      <p>The DSN format is converted into a PDO:DSN array. If you wish to bypass the PEAR-compatible format, you can specify
      PDO DSN right away in an array</p>

<?Code?>
$config['dsn']=array('mysql','user','password', $options);
<?/?>

        <h2>Establishing a Connection</h2>
        <p>The actual connection is established by Agile Toolkit through this line: </p>
        
<?Code?>
$this->api->dbConnect();
<?/Code?>

<p>Agile Toolkit uses persistant connections, but if you wish to bypass connection alltogether, you
can strategically place this line inside a controller or only on some of the pages which require
database access.</p>

<p>If you wish to create additinoal connections, you can create 'DB' object directly like this:</p>
<?Code?>
$db = $this->add('DB')->connect($dsn);
<?/Code?>

        <h3>SQL Queries Access from Agile Toolkit</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit was one of the first web frameworks to implement dynamic queries in 2003. DSQL is a very
        important component of Agile Toolkit, it is a fundamental concept behind Relational Models. The rest of the Views rely on
        Models to perform data operations.</p>

        <p>DSQL is a query builder and allows developer to construct query of any complexity through method calls. All of the methods
        are designed to be SQL-injection safe and will rely on parametric arguments of PDO. DSQL will also attempt to cache some of
        the query statements, which is extremely useful if only arguments are being modified</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit does not have a single query-string in it's traditional sense: "SELECT blah FROM tbl". Your job as a good
        programmer is not to introduce them.</p>

<?Code?>
$q = $this->api->db->dsql();
$q->table('employee');
$q->field('salary');
$q->where('id',1);
echo $q." = ".$q->getOne();
<?/Code?>

<p>Queries can also be iterated through, but it will be explained later.</p>
        
        <h3>Debugging Database Queries</h3>
        <p>To make any DSQL object expose its queries, execute the debug() method:</p>
<?Code?>
$q->debug();
<?/?>
<p>This will output the queries to the screen as they are being parsed. Even through the parametric values are used, the debug query
will place the actual values into the query enabling you to copy-paste output into your SQL console.</p>
