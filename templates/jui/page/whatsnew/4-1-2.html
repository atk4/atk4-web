		<h2>What's new in 4.1.2?</h2>
                <p>Version 4.1.2 adds a whole <b>4 new examples</b> into the downloadable ZIP archive. To keep things simple we decided to drop all the different ZIP files and have only one - agiletoolkit-4.1.2.zip. There are also bugfixes such as ability to use full url with getDestinationURL().</p>

        <p>Calling jui->addInclude() or js()->_load() will attempt to load JavaScript file dynamically through AJAX. Some 3rd party JavaScript add-ons do not like
        that. Previously developer would had to manually add include text into shared template, now you can simply call:
<?Code?>
$this->api->jui->addStaticInclude('myjsfile');
<?/?>
