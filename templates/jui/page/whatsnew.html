        <h3><span class="date">April 4<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/7ec46af5261da0d01f172d39a7ec966a53f04bee">form_body Tag Renamed</a></h3>
        <p>Default Form template used to contain &lt;?form_body?&gt; tag. That's the place in the form.html template, where
        fields are located. It's now been renamed into standard &lt;?Content?&gt; tag making addition of other elements into
        form body much easier:
<?Code?>
$f->add('H2')->set('appears after last field');
<?/?>

        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 26<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/13d4e8daa7b26bfddb747fe05426154f3c7a1afe">url_prefix improvement</a></h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit allows you to define url_prefix and url_postfix inside config. By default postfix is '.html' but you
        can change it into anything else. Now url_prefix can also be defined using question mark. Set it to '?page='
        and you no longer need .htaccess file. This is now a default behaviour for 4.0.2 branch too.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 26<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/b884e0d0a79552a486e054a81adadc591c6e2587">default-config.php support</a></h3>
        <p>Historically Agile Toolkit had no file with default config values. A sample use of
        getConfig('db/dsn','root@localhost/db'); was used where 2nd argument is providing a default value. In addition to
        that you can specify file with default config values inside config-default.php.
        </p>
        <p>Please, do not put your SQL password in there, it's not secure.</p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 25<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/5d918a7e7d20ca1ffa3dd15e9067a0c1309feca2">&lt;?page?&gt; and &lt;?template?&gt;</a></h3>
        <p>A few updates now adds support for global tags such as &lt;?page?&gt; and &lt;?template?&gt; to ALL Views.
        Previously only "template" tag was supported inside shared.html template. Now any template you can (and SHOULD) use 
        those tags. To remind — those tags substitute value inside them with the proper URL pointing to the resource. In case
        with page you can use values such as "index", "account/password", "./step2", or ".." which will define page
        relatively. Template tag will search for the file through PathFinder and stubstitute with the correct one.
        </p>
        <p>By using those tags your software links will always work even if you deploy your software NOT in the webroot</p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 24<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/30f63415c6c2962c9f09e3ebb6e6ebc6974136e4">univ().setTimeout() added</a></h3>
        <p>This function now allows you to access setTimeout function from inside PHP. Below code will submit a $form 5
        seconds after $field contents are changed:
<?Code?>
$field->js('change')->univ()->setTimeout(
    $form->js()->_enclose()->submit()
5000);
<?/?>
        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 24<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/e6b430a3cdd33f2db49dab5621569b7783fb8628">form_hybrid.html added</a></h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit already got several form styles: basic, horizontal, vertical. However now you can combine them
        inside the same form:
        
<?Code?>
$f->add('Form',null,null,array('form_hybrid'));
$f->setClass('basic'); // style for first section
// add fields here

$f->addSeparator('vertical');//next section style
// add fields here


$f->addSeparator('basic'); //next section style
// add fields here

<?/?>
        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 24<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/c0a37811d751487d586065bd1e7a24840b2fd13a">page/path/to.html</a></h3>
        <p>If page is not defined inside a .php class, then Agile Toolkit's ApiFrontend attempts to find a static template
        for this page. If page you are accessing is called my/sub/page.html then normally it would have loaded template from
        template/jui/page/my_sub_page.html. Now if this template is not found, Agile Toolkit will attempt to load
        template/jui/page/my/sub/page.html. This gives you a choice to select your own convention regarding storage of
        multi-level page templates.
        </p>

        <p>Developers are not form designers. That's why Agile Toolkit looks to bundle some nice styles you can choose from.
        <a href="<?page?>playground<?/?>">take a look at form styles</a>. To use them use the following code:
<?Code?>
$f=>this->add('Form');
$f->setFormClass('basic');
//$f->setFormClass('inline');
//$f->setFormClass('vertical');

//$f->setFormClass('basic atk-form-basic-2col');
//$f->setFormClass('vertical atk-form-vertical-2col');
<?/Code?>
        You can check out those forms in your installation by pointing brower at /playground.html
        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 23<em>rd</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/6788f40c1fd8fb6d38df79c709c3f7990fffe11c">Expander's new ID field</a></h3>
        <p>If you have ever used Grid Column type 'expander', you should know that they automatically locate "id" field in the Grid and will
        pass them as a GET argument to your sub-page. Creation of expander within expander were producing clashes between
        ID fields. Now grids will also determine and pass a get argument based on the table name used inside grid. For
        example if you are listing users in your grid from 'user' table, then expanders will pass user_id=123 along.
        </p>
        <p>The way how this is being determined is quite sophisticated and works with all variations of data sources for
        Grid.
        
<?Code?>
class page_test extends Pafe {
function initMainPage(){
    $g=this->add('MVCGrid');
    $g->setModel('User');
    $g->addColumn('expander','details');
}

function page_details(){
    $f=$this->add('MVCForm');
    $f->setModel('User')
        ->loadData($_GET['user_id']);
    if($f->isSubmitted()){
        $f->update();
        $f->js()->univ()
            ->successMessage('Saved')
            ->execute();
    }
}

} // class

        <h3><span class="date">March 22<em>nd</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/55ecffdd2ba4856e5666e3597da8dc914288867e">Agile Toolkit uses 960gs</a></h3>
        <p><a href="http://960.gs">960 Grid System</a> is designed for improved layouts inside your web applciations. The basic idea is to divide 960
        pixel width into 12 columns and provide classes with appropriate width for professional layout.
        </p>
        <p>Probably the biggest impact is on the forms, which now have proper width. The width depends on form class used,
        but you can select best appropriate form based on your layout and space available.
        </p><p>
        By the nature 960 layout is a fixed-width layout, however for compatibility we have made a it full-screen by default.
        If you would like to use a proper 960 fixed-width gs, then remove "atk-fullscreen" class from your &lt;body&gt; tag
        in shared.html
        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 21<em>st</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/44e76a80094d3d6608e271963006492ae5d262ce">Forms without submit handle</a></h3>
        <p>Often developers create form and forget to handle form's submit event. Because form expect to receive JavaScript
        when they are submitted, they wil attempt to evaluate wrongly returned HTML code and it usually comes up as AJAX
        parse error.</p>
        <p>This fix will add submit handler for all forms if you forgot to specify one. They will do nothing apart from
        putting error into standard javascript console about missing submit handler.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 15<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/356b0cb316d4e9742fba02118623b984627a7f9b">Extra class for jQuery UI dialog</a>
        </h3>
        <p>Normally to build a jQuery UI dialog you need a dedicated &lt;div&gt; element. univ().dialogURL() and similar
        functions are wrapper for jQuery UI dialogs and create that div automatically. However you might be willing to pass
        some class to that new dialog window. New Option for dialogURL() allows you to do that.
<?Code?>
$b->js('click')->univ()->dialogURL('Frame Title',
        $this->api->getDestinationURL('page2'),
        array('customClass'=>'my_custom_frame_class')
        );
<?/?>
        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 14<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/0686443822df61353d4d2e2b4f643895c210d8db">$dq-&gt;where('val in',$array)</a></h3>
        <p>where() method of Dynamic Queryes is used to properly escape 2nd argument. When you are performing basic
        comparisons it's quite straightforward where('gender','M'). However "in" operator allows to specify a number of
        values. Previously it was working only in this format:
<?Code?>
$dq->where('id in','1,2,3');
<?/?>
In this case each value separated by coma would be quoted separatelly. However this wouldn't work if the value you are trying to match would contain
comma. The new use format fixes that shortcoming:
<?Code?>
$dq->where('id in',array(1,2,3));
<?/?>
        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 14<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/119248b3f5f45ae8ad6473890d22f4c1e16c266f">Field's-&gt;setAttr()</a></h3>
        <p>Historically you could add properties to Form Fields using setProperty() metohd. Now you can use setAttr() which
        matches terminology of jQuery
<?Code?>
$f->addField('line','cvv','CVV')
    ->setAttr('size',3)
    ->setAttr('max-lenght',3);
<?/?>
        </p>

        <h3><span class="date">March 14<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/976f4747be595d177c86f60f1cff620c28fef069">univ()->bindFillInFields()</a></h3>
        <p>New function of univ() library allows to automatically fill-in values into other form fields when dropdown has
        been changed. This relies on included "dictionary" within your dropdown with the list of pre-defined correspondences
        between dropdown field value and values to be filled in in other fileds. <a href="<?page?>example/bindfillinfields<?/?>">Example
        of bindFillInFields</a>.

        <h3><span class="date">March 13<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/9ef5812a68fa882e6d85629e6e9b8ae5b8473a50">&lt;?field_type?&gt; in form tpl.</a></h3>
        <p>Form's template (form.html) contains a section which defines how each field should look. This region is called
        &lt;?form_line?&gt;. Prevously same form_line was used for all filed types. Now you can use field_type tag which will
        be initialized to the type of the field. This allows hard-core designers to properly define field width based on
        field type. For example textarea can now be bigger.
        </p>

        <h3>atk4_loader undergone many chages</h3>
        <p>Reloading of content is always a very delecate process. This method is used when you do $g-&lt;js()-&gt;reload().
        The problem with reloading is that it should properly replace contents with new data without loosing any ID's then
        re-apply javascript. When you are reloading contents of an element, then newly loaded data will typically contain new
        initialization of that same element, so it's important to properly destroy previous element. If you find a problem
        with reloading, please submit a bug.
        </p>

        <p>$api-&lt;getDestionationURL($page) can now be used with absolute URLs. It will still manage to properly append
        arguments to the URL (including sticky arguments).
        </p>

        <p>If your database contains HTML code and you will try to output it through Lister, then by default your HTML code
        will be escaped. To avoid this, you can disable this by setting $lister-&lt;safe_html_output=false;</p>
        <p>You can now also set $lister-&gt;nl2br_output=true; which will convert newlines into &lt;br/&gt; in your output.
        This is handy if you are outputing user-defined text with newlines.

        <p>If you are writing an Addon which requires Agile Toolkit of a certain version, you now can use the method
        versionRequirement().
<?Code?>
// my addon code
$this->api->versionRequirement('4.0.2');

        If version is older, it will terminate execution. Alternatively you can specify 2nd argument "true" and function will
        return boolean value instead.
