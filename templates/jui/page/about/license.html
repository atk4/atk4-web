<h1>Dual Licensing of Agile Toolkit</h1>
<!--<p>SaaS (Software as a Service) are reshaping the web with incredible speed. Many companies like Google or Yahoo have brought powerful interactive software many of us use everyday. Building your own Software as a Service solution is a tough task and requires a lot of housekeeping work. Fortunatelly - with Agile Toolkit you can instantly solve many of problems and make your software a reality.</p>-->
<p>Agile Toolkit uses a Dual License business model for its software development modules and offers licenses for commercial and opens source development.</p>

<p>We believe in open-source software. That is why we are willing to offer 10 years of our work on this library for free. But there is a catch. If you build your software using free version of Agile Toolkit, you have to make your software code freely available as well. Our choice of the open-source license is Affero General Public License - the license specifically written for Web Software.</br>
