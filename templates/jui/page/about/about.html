<p>Agile Toolkit is a PHP5 toolkit consisting of core framework, User Interface and JavaScript integration and APIs. The goal of Agile Toolkit is to allow web developer to produce rich, dynamic, stylish and powerful web application by only writing native PHP code and very little of it. With Agile Toolkit you can finally leave HTML to designers and JS to widget coders. Developing in Agile Toolkit is like "Mashing-up" apps from a ready-to-use components.</p>

<?MoreInfo?>What types of web applications are most suitable to be developed with Agile Toolkit?
<p>You will get the most benefit from writing your heavyily data-interactive system or backend in Agile Toolkit. Separation of business logic and UI will help you avoid going into PLSQL or JSON parsing with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit is perfect for web development with Agile approach. You can get results very quickly and then tweak interface, layouts, page structure, models throughout further iterations.</p>

<p>Building internet startups (SaaS) in Agile Toolkit is very efficient. When budget is limited, you need to get the job done and you want someone else to worry about technical details, such as form submission techniques. Agile Toolkit allows to add security measures, testing or more abstraction anytime down the road. You won't have to worry about code hacks or slow performance and if you keep up the good practices of Agile Toolkit.</p>

<p>Do you have idea for Open-Source project? How about a decent postfix-mysql database web interface? Agile Toolkit is a perfect match. Agile Toolkit is open-source, comes with awesomely looking UI and will help you interact with your database in a very advanced and secure way.</p>

<p>Developing CMS on Agile Toolkit is easy. There are all the components for you, all you need to do is organise them in a reasonable business manner to fit your client and you'll get highly-customized, fast, simple-looking and fool-proof backend and perfectly skinned frontend with no traces of Agile Toolkit.</p>

<?MoreInfo?>What exactly is Agile Toolkit? Is it a framework?
<p>Agile Toolkit is a <i>Collection of closely-coupled PHP5-based Object-Oriented classes for generation of rich HTML5-based web apps, organised into a modern framework and bundled with a great looking templates, CSS-based layouts and thin jQuery based client-side API</i>.</p>

<p>In simple terms - it gives you everything to keep your focused on your goals. It educates you how to develop properly. It makes any stuff you develop look great. When you become good with Agile Toolkit, you can re-implement the stuff you don't like, re-use stuff you like or build new stuff on top of existing.
</p>

<p>If you are familiar with JavaScript frameworks, the Agile Toolkit is similar in concept and design to jQuery and jQuery UI, but does it server-side.</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>Is it a new framework?
<p>Agile Toolkit was known previously as AModules and traces it's history to 1999. Each major release have been a major rewrite, although some of the code was just cleaned up and ported. Throughout it's history the toolkit have powered over 300 commercial projects. In 2010 it was decided to release Agile Toolkit publicly under open-source and commercial licenses</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit uses many of the concepts found in other frameworks, although they are implemented independently, often differently. Some features pre-dates appearance of their analogues in other frameworks. See how Agile Toolkit has evolved on <a href="/about/history.html">Agile Toolkit Timeline</a></p>

<?MoreInfo?>Why is it called Agile?
<p>
Agile Toolkit is perfect when it comes to Web Development using Agile Approach. Some of the principles behind Agile Methodology are also principles behind design of Agile Toolkit such as:
<ul>
<li>Getting first version done quickly. Agile Toolkit comes with objects which work with minimum configuration. Your first prototype is few days away.</li>
<li>Ability to see work in progress, demonstrate it to client for feedback. With powerful web UI maintained by Agile Toolkit you have a solid foundation to build upon. Maintaining a healthy UI from the start gives ability to demonstrate progress of all developers.</li>
<li>Use most efficient way of development. Agile Toolkit supports a lot of ways to enhance your software, but they are all optional. If you need to deliver software quickly, no environment beats Agile Toolkit.</li>
<li>If your working in teams, nothing is more frustrating than waiting for Design team to finish mock-ups or Backend team to re-implement a feature. Agile Toolkit allows JavaScript developer, UI developer, Designer and Back-end developer to work independently and then join their work together.</li>
</ul>

<?MoreInfo?>I am beginner, will I understand it?
<p>Yes. The core concept of Agile Toolkit is really simple. We have shown project code to people who have no development experience and they admit it's very clear and self-explanatory. </p>

<p>To start with Agile Toolkit you will need to go through Introduction and Tutorial. Afterwards you can simply mash-up your application from blocks.</p>
<p><i>Developing simple website with Agile Toolkit is certainly easier than doing it in plain PHP.</i></p>

<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>I am hardcore developer / hacker. Will it restrict me?
<p>No. Agile Toolkit is based on several powerful concepts (such as abstraction) often used by senior developers. Agile Toolkit attempts to be very elegant and achieve a lot of functionality through a small amount of "clever" code.</p>

<p>As a power user, you will be able to take advantage of re-usability and customization to avoid any restrictions.</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>Can I make website with ATK? Is it a CMS?
<p>Yes. You need to know very little from PHP to use Agile Toolkit. Agile Toolkit is well suited for CMS-based sites with custom logic and interactive behavior.</p>

<p>Our <a target="_blank" href="http://agiletech.ie/">website for Agile Technologies</a> similarly uses Agile Toolkit, but there the content is stored in MySQL database and is editable on-line, which makes it a proper CMS system.</p>

<p>Unless you want to make a quick website for your client within 1 day time, Agile Toolkit will give you much greater flexibility and control over content, dynamic interaction and web2.0 of your website.

<h2>Why another PHP framework?</h2>
<p>Agile Toolkit has the following goals:
<ol>
<li>Implement Object-Oriented user interface. Let developers focus on the logic and take care of presentation.</li>

<li>Be suitable for business applications. Target PHP professionals who want result and stability.</li>

<li>Make it simple to implement things but DONT implement them all. Keep things OUT from framework core.</li>

<li>Agile Toolkit is ALWAYS faster development. Even for small things.</li>

<li>Make code simple and very easy to drill down into the code. Great for learning. Once you understand Agile Toolkit, you can understand any app.</li>

<li>Be insanely extensible, even more extensible than that for add-on authors. Remain intuitive and simple for developer.</li>

<li>Designed to absorb experience. Double form submits? Deployment ad SQL migration? Model-level field-access restriction? Built-in strong encryption or oAuth? Agile Toolkit does them all in a very transparent way.</li>

</ol>



<?MoreInfo?>How Agile Toolkit approach to User Interface compares with other UI frameworks?

<p>We have found that other frameworks often have one of the following 3 disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Too difficult to use. Simple stuff takes lots of code.</li>
<li>Distant from Web Experience. Not sufficiently flexible.</li>
<li>Lacking extensibility and ecosystem. Only good for small projects.</li>

<p>Agile Toolkit comes with default User Interface based on jQuery UI CSS framework. Firstly, it creates a easy way for developer to build his own controls and modify existing ones. Form implementation is much simpler than forms found in other frameworks, yet it is based on solid foundation of Agile Toolkit making those forms much more powerful.</p>

<p>With Agile Toolkit you will be able to push customization of your Web Application to new limits and the framework will help you along the way.</p>

<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>I have noticed that Agile Toolkit does not have the "accordion" (or other) feature.
<p>Instead of bundling bunch of ready-to-use JavaScript widgets, we are making it really simple for our developers to use 3rd party jQuery and jQuery UI plugins. If you are in need of accordion, why not use one by jQuery UI?</p>
<p>
It only takes one line of code to activate the accordion. It is also really simple to build your own re-usable accordion which you can use throughout your application.
