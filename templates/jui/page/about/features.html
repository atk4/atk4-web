<h1>Agile Toolkit features</h1>

<p>Agile Toolkit is a PHP5 framework developed by Agile Technologies. The Toolkit includes a solid MVC framework, a large number of ready-to-use widgets and controllers and it is specifically designed for lean, agile Web Software development.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit is split in 2 components:
<ul>
<li>Agile Toolkit Core - this provides efficient integration to any other frameworks.
<li>ATK Interface Library - introduces set of visual components and speeds up development of UI incredibly.
</ul>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">1. Highly re-usable modules</td>
<td>A typical Software as a Service (SaaS) application re-uses 80% of code written for other similar applications. The Agile Toolkit has developed this common code as modules that you can use so that you can focus your effort on the 20% that makes your code different.</br></br>

Re-usage modules mean:
<ol><li>Takes less time to build your application</li>
<li>Robust, scalable code build for expanding on</li>
<li>Enables you to focus on the unique parts of your software</li></ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">2. Front end interface design</td>
<td>About 30% of the time and budget in each project is spend developing the front end HTML & User Interface (UI). User Interface is often the most powerful selling point for SaaS applications so here's what we do t make it easier.</br></br>
Agile Tookit UI advantages:
<ol>
<li>It allows the interface throughout the application</li>
<li>The Developer can create simple user interface without involving a designer or knowing HTML</li>
<li>The Designer can develop html templates independently of development. Later either the developer or designer can apply them to the software with ease.</li>
<li>The Agile Toolkit UI follows design guidelines and web standards</li>

</ol>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">3. Security is built-in</td>
<td>The Agile Toolkit is built according to general practices and recommendations for secure software published by <a href="http://www.owasp.org/">OWASP</a>. This takes the responsibility of maintaining security away from developers.</br></br>
What it means for the developer:
<ol>
<li>You don't have to worry about security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>There are Less testing and audits involved</li>
<li>Security standards are already in place</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">4. Business goal oriented design</td>
<td>Agile Toolkit was built with a business owners in mind. The framework requires less training and has extensive documentation for every business feature you would need.</br></br>
<ol>
<li>Less training involved</li>
<li>Business goals can be achieved in minutes</li>
<li>Simple and extensive <a href="http://agiletoolkit.org/doc/">documentation</a></li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">5. Newest technology</td>
<td>Microsoft, Apple and Google are collaboratively promoting newest technological standards for web. For other companies to take advantage of those new technologies takes a lot of learning and getting used to.</br></br>
Agile Framework allows you to:
<ol>
<li>Produce great results with HTML5, JavaScript and CSS</li>
<li>Includes technologies such as jQuery, jQuery UI and MVC</li>
<li>Creates richer client-side software using AJAX technologies</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">6. Less dependancies between team members</td>
<td>A typical web project includes an architect, user interface designer, developer, and business analyst. Usually each of these depends on deliverables from the other in order to carry out their work. What if more of their work could be carried out independently of each-other?</br></br>
Th Agile Toolkit is designed for:
<ol>
<li>Less management and paperwork</li>
<li>Each person can implement what they know best.
<li>This is easier to merge than with other frameworks</li>
<li>You don't have to put them in one room to deliver result</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">7. Fast and highly scalable</td>
<td>The Toolkit use Object-Oriented-Design with each components separated in Modules. For example, in a social networking application, when a logged in user looks at their profile page, the profile page does not need the code responsible for "login". Instead this is in the login module with only a tag necessary on the profile page. </br></br>

In other words, visual elements such as Forms, Grids, Tables and Menus are dynamically loaded only as required. If AJAX is used to re-draw a Form then the other components on the page are excluded from the form. A similar approach works on front end with JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery UI components loaded on demand. This makes software fast and efficient.

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">8. Integrated</td>
<td>Many frameworks decide to have as few dependencies on other components as possible. Using them often limits the developer in terms of licensing and leaves a huge code footprint. </br> In contrast, the Agile Toolkit relies on standard components such as XML, DOM and XSLT to perform all the tasks. Most of the work is done by relevant PHP extensions.</br></br>
<ol>
<li>This makes your solution highly customisable and extensive, Easier to maintain in long term, but we also esure that there is no licensing implications on 3rd party modules.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">9. Supported</td>
<td>If you use open source software, you know that it always comes "as is". The creators of the software bear no warranty. Eventually the software achieves good results (such as Linux, Apache or PHP itself), but this requires high level of control, management and at least 2 major rewrites.</br></br>
Agile Toolkit has a commercial license which allows us to maintain and improve our product. We continually maintain and improve the code base and we add components which are demanded for commercial users.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">10. Licensing</td>
<td>The Agile Toolkit is licensed per developer per year. With introduction of cloud computing and the physical limits on CPU speeds, more and more people are looking for horizontal scaling - that is running more computers to do the job. We don't charge you per server and we don't charge you if you use our software to do open source projects. We feel that this is much reasonable licensing on longer run.
