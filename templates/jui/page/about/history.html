<h1>Development History of Agile Toolkit</h1>
<p>The Agile Toolkit has a rich development history. It started in 1999 and was previously developed as AModules. The library was completely rewritten at several times through its lifespan - when first migrated to PHP4 and when the alpha version of PHP5 (Zend2) become available.</p>

<p>The Toolkit was heavily influenced by the Object-Oriented windowed environment. For instance reliance on "init" method as a secondary constructor comes from Turbo Vision and many of other approaches are coming from Object Windows frameworks and Objective C / Cocoa used in Apple UI. The true goal however was to keep flexibility required by Web projects, instead of porting concepts.</p>

<p>Historically by several measurements Agile Toolkit and its ancestors have introduced several concepts before other frameworks did. For example dynamic queries were used in AModules3 since 2004 for both queries, updates, deletes and other operations. Even today many frameworks only have "select" support for dynamic queries.</p>
