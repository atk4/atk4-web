<p>The Agile Toolkit exist because of the continious effort by two of it's main authors. Romans Malinovskis is inventor of original concept and have been enhancing the toolkit throughout the decade. Dmitry Malinovskis (a.k.a Mayack) is a designer of Agile Toolkit's interface. Only as a collaboration between a developer and a designer, Agile Toolkit was able to gain it's User Interface components.</p>

<p><u>Romans</u>: <i>My obsession with Object-Oriented programming has begun when I was 15. I have programmed in Object-Pascal and Turbo Vision, early Windows Objects and have built my own Object-Oriented environments for games and point-and-click user interfaces. As my carrier slowly shifted towards web devleopment in 1999 I have started experementing with implementing objects on a database-driven environments.</i></p>

<p><i>When first news of Zend 2 Engine Alpha reached Latvia, I have created a new directory and started working on AModules3, a successor of PHP4-based framework AModules2.</i></p>

<p><i>Last major breakthrough was done in 2009 when we re-wrote all the JavaScript APIs. At the same time we also added Model and Active Record concepts based on DSQL, which became the standard for any software we developed in the following 2 years.</i></p>

<p>Mayack is a bleeding-edge web designer, who would work hard just to get rid of unnecessary &lt;div&gt;s in HTML source. Being huge fan of new CSS3 and HTML5 he have joined development of AModules2 framework in 2004 and also participated in many commercial projects developed with the framework.</p>

<p>Mayack: <i>The problem with AModules2 was its inability to use templates and make any complex layouts on the page. You could only put one form or one grid on the page. The grid would also would look the same. That's when we decided to use SMlite globaly for all the components and pages.</i></p>

<p><i>In our commercial projects each client needed something completely unique and different. We have adopted 960 GS system and then later switched to Fluid GS. Only recently we have introduced multiple layouts for forms so that developers can do even more without worrying about the look.</i></p>
