<div id="getting-started-core">
	<i class="big-icon icon-core"></i>
	<p>We are offering highly technical comparison pages with aim to show differences in ideology and approach. If any
	information here is not correct, please contact us.</p>
</div>

<p>Zend Framework is produced by Zend Technologies and distributed under the New BSD license. Philosophy of the framework is use-at-will and apart from code guidelines framework does not enforce components to follow any standard or be compatible.
</p>

<p>Zend Technologies offers framework for commercial and non-commercial use at no cost. Zend Technologies sells Zend Server platform as well as development tools, which have great support for ZF which is a framework monetization route for the company.

<h2>Ideology comparison</h2>
<p>
Agile Toolkit does not pursuit a goal to use all the PHP features. There are many PHP features which Agile Toolkit team decided not to use. ZF is most popular in enterprise environment, where development resources are unlimited and development or software efficiency and speed is irrelevant. Agile Toolkit focuses on efficiency, small code footprint and result, which are more suitable for Web startups, enterpreneurs, freelancers and small businesses</p>

<h2>Database approach</h2>
<p>
ZF does not include any structure for model implementation — implementation is up to developers.
