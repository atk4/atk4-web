<h1>Getting Answers</h1>
<p>Agile Toolkit developer community relies on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> portal for free community support and discussions. On Stack Overflow you earn reputation points by asking questions or answering them in a very structured way. Compared to Forums this makes it much easier to search for solutions and helps us get other experts involved</p>

<h3>Accepting answers</h3>
<p>When your question receives some answers, you should "accept" the answer which helped you to solve your problem. That will give reputation to the person who supplied the answer.</p>
