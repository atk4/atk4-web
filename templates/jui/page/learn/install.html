        <h3>Installing Agile Toolkit</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit is designed to work as soon as you download it. You don't need to setup a database, any custom
        routing, or modules. Agile Toolkit does not use code generation. It is simple and straight-forward.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of tweaking capabilities, but as with anything in Agile Toolkit, it's designed to 'just work' out-of-the-box.</p>
