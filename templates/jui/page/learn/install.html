        <h3>Installing Agile Toolkit</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit is designed to work as soon as you download it. You don't need to setup database or any custom
        routing or modules. Agile Toolkit does not use code generation. It is simple and straight-forward.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of tweaking capabilities, but as with any thing in Agile Toolkit, it's designed to work out of the
        box.</p>
