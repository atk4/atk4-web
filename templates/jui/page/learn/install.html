    <h3>Installing Agile Toolkit</h3>
    <p>Agile Toolkit is designed to work as soon as you download it. You don't need to setup a database, any custom
    routing, or modules at the start. Agile Toolkit does not use code generation. Code generation is YOUR job and you
    will learn to love it.</p>

    <p>Agile Toolkit makes many things look simple and makes many decisions for you, but you always have the power to override
    every single detail about what and how Agile Toolkit is doing.</p>
