    <h1>What is Agile Toolkit?</h1>

    <p>Agile Toolkit is a set of cooperating PHP classes and supporting assets that make up a reusable design for general purpose web software.</p>

    <p>Allow me to rephrase this in simpler terms.</p>

    <p>When a developer is working on software, he faces a number of challenges. By applying his vast experience and software design skills he might come up with great solutions. The quality of those solutions are a key to the speed, security, ease of use and flexibility of the resulting code. After solving these challenges many times, a collection of "solutions" emerge.</p>

    <p>Simply stated, a PHP framework is a collection of these "solutions". Authors of PHP frameworks decide what "solutions" to include into their framework. To make it easier for others to understand and use the framework, the approach to each problem needs to be consistent; solutions must be precise and easy to understand. For decades now, lots and lots of PHP Classes have been in circulation which tackle certain problems in different ways and from time to time these classes have been packaged and distributed: PEAR, Zend, Symfony, PHPClasses.org and so on</p>

    <p>Agile Toolkit is also a collection of PHP classes which is designed to solve certain problems. Agile Toolkit is based on it's own philosophy and also on several development paradigms. Agile toolkit includes support files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Every file included in the distribution is a result of 10-year refinement and re-use across thousands of web projects, big and small.</p>

    <p>It is the choice of principles, clever decisions and great ideas that make Agile Toolkit special.</p>

    <h2>Agile Toolkit Core Concepts</h2>

    <p>To use Agile Toolkit successfully, you must understand it's concepts. The most significant concept is that everything is an object. Your application is an object, the page is an object, a database connection is an object and buttons are objects too. Objects are described using PHP classes. Objects carry some information inside of them and are also interconnected with other objects, but in a very regulated way.</p>

    <h3>Adding Objects</h3>
    <p>Objects is the instance of a class. One class may have multiple instances and they are independent. In Agile Toolkit you don't create instances using a "new" statement, instead you "add" objects into other objects. It is, in a way, similar, but objects are by default connected with the rest of your application.</p>

    <p>Any object of Agile Toolkit would have a reference to it's owner - the object which spawned it. It also has a reference to the top-most object - Application object.</p>

    <h3>The "Views"</h3>
    <div style="float: right">
      <?Execute?>
      $page->add('Button')->set('This is a "Button" View');
      <?/?>
    </div>

    <p>The first fundamental concept of Agile Toolkit is <b>the "View"</b>. View is an object which can represent itself through a chunk of HTML code.</p>

    <p>The button you see on the right is the object instance of "Button" class. "Button" class extends "View" class and therefore can be placed on the page. A View can incorporate it's custom template, additional CSS and dependencies to jQuery plug-ins.</p>

    <p>Agile Toolkit has many fundamental view classes for you to use. More importantly — you will be developing your own views or getting them through Agile Add-On Manager. You can easily override an HTML template or any logic behind the View and make it look exactly how YOU want.</p>

    <h3>The "Render Tree"</h3>
    <?Execute?>
    $frame = $page->add('HtmlElement')->addStyle('border','1px dashed red')->addStyle('padding','5px');
    $frame = $frame->add('HtmlElement')->addStyle('border','1px dashed green')->addStyle('padding','5px');
    $frame->add('Button')->set('Same Button Class');
    <?/?>

    <p>Application creates other views and objects. A structure of visible "views" is called a "Render" tree. After it's initialized, it will be converted into HTML in a process called "rendering".</p>

    <h3>The "Model" Class</h3>
<?Code?>
$page->add('Form')->setModel('Person')->load($person_id);
<?/?>

    <p>The next fundamental concept is the Model Class. Models describe your business data. Models are what your application will operate with. It's quite similar to names of SQL tables but more powerful, because Models are hierarchical. Models contain meta-information about your data records: field names, types, labels, validation rules, custom actions, hints and more. Models act as an Active Record allowing you to operate with either a single record or multiple records.</p>

    <p>Models can be associated with Views. This is how you can populate form or table fields easily. Association is done through a "setModel()" method.

    <h3>The "Controller" Class</h3>
<?Code?>
$model->add('Controller_Encrypt')->useField('account_number')->useEncryption('rsa');
<?/?>

<?Code?>
$api->add('Controller_PatternRouter')
  ->addRule("profile/(.*)", "profile/details", array("profile_id"))	
  ->addRule("blog/([0-9]*)-.*", "blog/item", array("id"))	
  ->route();
<?/?>

    <p>Controllers in Agile Toolkit are classes which "Enrich" the functionality of existing objects. The "Controller_Encrypt" adds the ability into a "Model" to use strong encryption on some of the fields. The PatternRouter controller adds pattern matching and PHP-based rewrites.</p>

    <p>Controllers are used when you connect to database, associate view with model, use pagination on the form, add "strength" indicator into the password field or add anti-XSF tokens into the form class.</p>

    <h3>The "Application" Class</h3>
    <p>Application class holds the universe of Agile Toolkit together. It's the top-most class in the Runtime Tree. Application class relies on a number of controllers to do some of the basic functionalities, such as error output or URL generation.</p> 

    <p>Your application extends the base API class in Agile Toolkit. If you are building an application which you plan to re-use and customise, you will be able to extend your application further creating some beautiful object hierarchy.</p>

    <h3>The "Agile Store"</h3>
    <p>Given the powerful architecture of Agile Toolkit, there are many different extensions, templates, models and the whole UI pages. The "Agile Store" which is introduced in 4.2 of Agile Toolkit is the way of us saying - "Got a nice piece of code? Why not share and perhaps even make some money on it!". Or if you are looking for a good quality add-on, why not purchase it from someone for the price of a "Frappuchino".</p>

    <p>Some examples of what you can find in the store are: "Comment Anywhere" - plug-in, that you can put on any page, which enables users to comment on anything. "ModelAudit" - a controller to make your models auditable (records editing operations into separate table) and also brings the views for you to look at the audit history. "Countries" - delivers a model containing an up-to-date list of countries. "Job Queue" - a system for implementing your own Cloud-Powered Job Processing queues based on SQL or SQS. There are many others too.</p>


    <h2>Removing the Packaging</h2>
    <p>If you haven't done this already — download Agile Toolkit. In the next chapter I will guide you through the installation process of Agile Toolkit so that you can try different examples inside your own copy of Agile Toolkit.</p>

    <h2>Fives types of objects in Agile Toolkit</h2>

    <p>I have only mentioned "Visual" objects, or views. There are actually 5 object types in Agile
    Toolkit, and they are described below.
    </p>

    <h3>Application (API)</h3>


    <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop1.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
    <p>In simple terms, an Application (web application) helps the user manage server-side data. For each request made by the user, the web application needs to collect information from the data storage, and produce a response to the user.</p>

    <h3>Pages</h3>

    <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop3.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
    <p>A Page is a page. That's what we see when we open a book. It's also what we see when we open a website. On a website
    we navigate between the pages using hyperlinks. The pages in a website can look very different from each other, but they can also share many common components, such as a navigation menu, the general layout of the site, or the general 'look' (style) of the site.
    </p>

    <p>It makes sense to build a page using an object-oriented approach. This way one page may easily 'inherit' another. For example:
    you might have a generic 'signup' page, and easily develop a 'registration' page which will 'inherit' the functionality of the signup, and extend it - like in our example.</p>

    <p>In Agile Toolkit — Pages define UI logic. Often a skilled designer can understand the code in Page definitions, and even change
    some of the PHP code themselves. It's essential to separate UI logic from business logic, which is defined in Models.</p>

    <h3>Models</h3>

    <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop6.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
    <p>Models are objects mimicking real-world objects. Depending on your application, you will define different types of models. For instance: for a job site, you may have JobApplication, User and other similar objects.</p>

    <p>Again, the object-oriented approach makes a lot of sense for modelling your application classes. If you have different
    user types, they would extend the same parent class.</p>

    <p>Some plug-ins may include some generic models. For instance there is a model for "Country", along with a database table
    with content for the model. It contains the official list of ISO countries and codes. Including such a model can save you development
    time and help you update your application when the country list is updated or changed.</p>

    <h3>Views</h3>

    <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop5.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
    <p>Views are Widgets. While widgets in many frameworks are programmed using procedures and functions, the Views in Agile Toolkit are also implemented using Object-Oriented design: as classes. One View can inherit another View, or it can contain other views within itself.</p>

    <p>Procedural widgets are aimed at end-users. You, as developer, can understand the benefit of an object-oriented approach
    better. That's why views in Agile Toolkit are not designed to serve all purposes, instead they are designed to
    be simply extended and tweaked, to work the way you need.

    <h3>Controllers</h3>

    <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop4.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
    <p>Your application needs a lot of functionality. Some of it will help you deal with specific problems, such as template
    parsing, or database access.</p>

    <p>Controllers in Agile Toolkit enhance functionality of their parent object. Controller may enhance the way
    errors are displayed, the way audit is done on your models, or how pagination works in your grid.</p>

    <p>As controllers often have common functionality, object-oriented architecture can help us out here. For instance: you could have
    different authorization mechanisms - different authorization controllers - based on a generic authorization class.</p>

    <h2>What is Abstraction?</h2>

    <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop2.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
    <p>The Button object is designed to do one thing only: implement a button. The Form object, on the other hand, is meant to implement forms. It may, however, rely on a Button in order to do its job.</p>

    <p>Going further up, a Page object's job is to implement a single page. The Page relies on objects such as Forms, Buttons blocks of text and so on. Finally the top-most object - which relies on Pages, Authentication, Database connectivity, many other objects, and which is meant to implement your whole web application - is the Application object.</p>

    <p>All of the objects have a few qualities in common. They rely on each other to do their job. They hide the complexity of their implementation behind their interfaces.</p>

    <p>As a good and efficient developer, your job is to understand the importance of abstraction, and to be able to
    implement additional objects to fit in their proper roles. Objects must always take advantage of other objects
    if possible, and each object must be simple to use.</p>

    <h2>Moving forward</h2>
    <p>To learn Agile Toolkit, you need to first understand the concept of Applications and PMVC (Page, Model, View,
    Controller). You don't have to understand in detail how each of these objects work right away, but as you learn how each one works, and how they fit in with each other, you'll gradually understand and appreciate the structure of the framework as a whole.</p>

    <p>The approach we take in the Learning chapter will focus on one thing at a time. However, the first thing is to get
    your own copy of Agile Toolkit, so you can try things out. If you do not wish to install Agile Toolkit yet,
    you can <a href="<?page?>learn/understand<?/?>">skip the installation part</a>.
