        <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>

        <p>OOP is one of the major concepts in the world of Computing. Objects in computing are "Black Boxes". You can
        interact with object, but you do not have to worry about it's implementation. Object contain data and methods. Also
        objects are always created based on a "Class" prototype. (For more info on Object Oriented Software Design read
                <a href="http://softwaredesign.com/objects.html" target="_blank">Read this article</a>).</p>

        <p>For a practical example in PHP on how to use Objects efficiently, <a
        href="http://agiletoolkit.org/blog/how-to-use-object-oriented-programming-in-php/" target="_blank">read this blog
        post</a>.

<div style="float: right">
<?Execute?>
$page->add('Button')->set('This is object');
<?/?>
</div>
        <p>When Object Oriented Design is applied to Web Development it abstracts the way how you operate with Web Objects
        such as forms, buttons, pages, links and other. Instead of writing HTML, CSS ad JavaScript code you now interact with
        a native object in PHP.</p>

        <p>The button on the right is a fairly simple example of an object in Agile Toolkit. A more complex objects can
        implement forms, signup wizards, payment forms, file manager, poll, comment feed an so on. Regardless of which object
        you are using, it's straightforward and simple.</p>

        <p>Another and very significant property of an Object is ability to inherit and extend it. When a new object class is
        defined, it can inherit all methods and properties from another class. It can then override and re-define some of
        them. This allows developer to extend functionality of the base class without messing with it.</p>

        <h2>Fives types of objects in Agile Toolkit</h2>

        <p>I have only mentioned "Visual" objects or views. There are actually 5 objects types in Agile
        Toolkit and they are described below.
        </p>

        <h3>Application (API)</h3>


        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop1.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>In simple terms, web application helps user manage server-side data. For each request by the user, web application
        needs to collect information from the data storage and produce response to that user.</p>

        <h3>Pages</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop3.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Page is a page. That's what we see when we open a book. It's also what we see when we open a website. On a websate
        we navigate between the pages. Pages can be different, but can also share common components such as look or layout.
     </p>

        <p>It makes sense to build page through object oriented approach. This way one page may inherit another. For example
        you might have a generic signup page which is further extended by similar registration form for different
        scenarios, like in our example.</p>

        <p>In Agile Toolkit — Pages define UI logic. Often skilled designer could understand Page definitions or even change
        some of the PHP code. It's essential to separate UI logic from business logic, which is defined in Models.</p>

        <h3>Models</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop6.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Models are objects mimicking a real-world objects. Depending on your application, models will be defined
        differently. For instance for job site you may have JobApplication, User and similar other objects.</p>

        <p>Again, object-oriented approach makes a lot of sense for modeling your application classes. If you have different
        user types, they would extend same parent class.</p>

        <p>Some plug-ins may include some generic models. For instance there is model for "Country" along with database table
        with content. It contains official list of ISO countries and codes. Including such a model can save you development
        time and help you update your application when country list is updated or changed.</p>

        <h3>Views</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop5.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Views are Widgets. Except that the View is also implemented in Object-Oriented design - as a class. One View can
        inherit another View or it can contains some other views within itself.</p>

        <p>Unlike widgets which are oriented at end-users, you, as developer, understand benefit of object-oriented approach
        much better. That's why views in Agile Toolkit are not designed to serve all purposes, instead they are designed to
        be simply extended and tweaked the way you need.

        <h3>Controllers</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop4.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Your application needs a lot of functionality. Some would help you deal with specific problems such as template
        parsing or database access.</p>

        <p>Controllers in Agile Toolkit enhance functionality of their parent object. Controller may enhance the way how
        errors are displayed, how audit is done on your models or how pagination works in your grid.</p>

        <p>As controllers often have common things, object-oriented architecture helps here out. For instance you could have
        different authorization mechanisms based on generic authorization class.</p>

        <h2>Application as a glue</h2>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop2.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Agile Toolkit is different from frameworks because each of the objects above are capable of automatically interact
        with each-other. For example when you add View on the page and bind it with Model, it will automatically figure out
        which controllers to load and how to manipulate data or draw itself.</p>

        <p>Simple design of adding objects ultimatelly carries dependencies through the Application. Object will referr to
        application's default DB manager when trying to do data loading.</p>

        <p>As developer, however, you may create multiple applications at the same time. Having two applications at the same
        time might seem unnatural at first, but it makes a lot of sense when one application is testing another or
        authentication is exchanged.</p>

        <h2>Moving forward</h2>
        <p>To learn Agile Toolkit, you need to first understand this concept of APMVC (Application, Page, Model, View,
                Controller). If you do not yet understand this concept, we will re-visit it after "installation" section.</p>
