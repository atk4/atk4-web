        <h1>Authentication and Authorization</h1>
        <p>Different web applications will employ different authorization and authentication strategies. In some
        cases, access to the entire application is restricted unless the user enters a password. In other cases, the users can 
        access most of the functions in the application, however gain additional functionality if authenticated.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit provides a basic authentication mechanism, with support for white-list and black-list strategies.</p>

<?MoreInfo?>Terminology
<ul>
<li>Authentication — a process where a user provides their username and password, or uses some other means for identifying themselves, such as OpenID</li>
<li>Authorization — defining the type of operations which the current user can or cannot do.</li>
<li>white-list — an authorization strategy under which all actions/pages are restricted, unless specifically allowed. White-list is considered more secure than black-list.</li>
<li>black-list - an autorization strategy under which a check for restricted actions/pages is performed in order to disallow user access.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Using The BasicAuth Class</h3>
        <p>The BasicAuth controller is a simple implementation of the Authentication class. Below is an example of usage from inside the API
        class:</p>
<?Code?>
$this->add('BasicAuth')->allow('john','secret')->allow('peter','shoeshine')->check();
<?/Code?>

        <p>The above code will add BasicAuth into the API, manually allow 2 users to have access, then perform the check. You will
        see a login form when accessing any page handled by this API. Class SQLAuth can be used if you wish to authenticate
        users against the database.</p>
<?Code?>
$this->add('SQLAuth')->setSource('user','login','password')->useEncryption('sha1')->check();
<?/Code?>

        <h3>Implementing White-List</h3>
        <p>Both black-list and white-list implementation depend on executing - or bypassing - the "check" method. In a white-list
        implementation, if check() is not executed, then authentication is not required. You can use allowPage() to specify which
        pages do not need authentication, and then use isPageAllowed() to determine when to perform the check(). Note that if the 
        user is logged in, even without having explicitly called check() - ie., when visiting an allowed page - their login information 
        will be available.</p>

<?Code?>
$this->add('SQLAuth');     // automatically sets $api->auth to self
$this->auth->allowPage('privcay');
$this->auth->allowPage(array('faq','contact','about'));
$this->auth->setSource('user','login','password');
$this->auth->useEncryption('sha1');
if($this->auth->isPageAllowed($this->page)){
    $this->auth->check();
}
<?/Code?>

        <h3>Implementing black-list</h3>
        <p>To keep non-authenticated users away from certain pages you should move the call to $api->check() to inside those pages.</p>

<?Code?>
// inside page/secret.php, in page's init() method

$this->api->auth->check();
$this->add('Text')->set('Hello user with id=',$this->api->auth->get('id'));
<?/Code?>

        <h3>Enhancing The Authentication Query</h3>
        <p>As mentioned on a previous page, you can enhance your authentication query by interacting directly with the $auth->dq object.
         Adding an SQLAuth object, then calling setSource will return a newly created DSQL object for your convenience. The query can 
         then be customised with this object, before calling check().</p>

<?Code?>
$this->add('SQLAuth')
    ->setSource('user','login','password')
    ->join('user_role ur','ur.user_id=user.id')
    ->where('ur.type','admin')
    ->field('last_login, name');

if($this->auth->check()){
    // Executed only first time user has authenticated.

    $this->js(true)->univ()->successMessage('Welcome back, '.
            $this->auth->get('name').' your previous login was on '.
            $this->auth->get('last_login')
            );

    $this->auth->dq->set('last_login',date('Y-m-d'))->do_update();
}
<?/Code?>
