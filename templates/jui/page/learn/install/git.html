        <h1>Usage with Git and Subversion</h1>
        <p>Source control system is an absolute necessity in modern software development. Depending on the type of project
        you might want to use either Git or Subversion. Agile Toolkit uses Git due to its open-source nature. If you are
        willing to add changes to Agile Toolkit, you can <a href="http://github.com/atk4/atk4/">fork it on GitHub.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Git Introduction</h3>
        <p>If you want to use the most up-to-date copy of Agile Toolkit, then you will need to use "git". Git is a
        command-line interface utility, which is executed as "git command arguments ..'. A good starting guide on Git is: <a
        href="http://book.git-scm.com/">http://book.git-scm.com</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4">https://github.com/atk4/atk4</a> is the GitHub page for Agile Toolkit. You will
        find a "branch" switch as well as a selection of tags. There are two major branches: "devel" and "master". All the
        stable releases are based on the "master" branch, while beta releases are based on the "devel" branch. Sometimes new feature
        branches will appear, as experimental features are being developed.</p>

        <p>The documentation on this site applies to the 4.1 branch (or later, where specified). As the code in the project is improved,
        some functions might be renamed. Backwards compatibility is maintained throughout one major upgrade release, for instance: 
        migrating 4.0 code to 4.1 probably works well and requires little change, but migrating from 4.0 to 4.2 might require you to change 
        several calls to functions which have been made obsolete. Some older classes may be removed and placed under the "atk4-obsolete" 
        repository. If your legacy code still relies on them, copy them into your local lib directory or, use the addLocation() method.</p>

        <h3>Share Your Project</h3>
        <p>If you are developing a non-commercial project with Agile Toolkit under the AGPL license, we invite you to share this
        project on GitHub.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open <a href="http://github.com/">github.com</a>, login and create a new repository. Follow instructions.</li>
        <li>Remove atk4 / atk4-addons if you have downloaded them through ZIP</li>
        <li>Checkout atk4 and atk4-addons directly through Git<br/>
<?Code?>
$ git submodule add git@github.com:atk4/atk4.git
$ git submodule add git@github.com:atk4/atk4-addons.git
$ git submodule update
<?/?>
        </li>
        <li>If you want the development branch:<br/>
<?Code?>
$ cd atk4
$ git checkout devel
$ cd ..

$ cd atk4-addons
$ git checkout devel
$ cd ..
<?/?>
        </li>
        <li>use "git status" and create your own .gitignore file. Add "config.php", ".htaccess" and other files which you do
        not wish to share to your .gitignore.
        
<?MoreInfo?>Why is placing config.php and .htaccess into Git/SVN bad?
<p>The config.php file contains server-specific configuration. This configuration might include private keys, a mysql password or some other sensitive information. Adding this information to Git may expose it publicly on-line to people who woludn't normally have access to your server.</p>
<p>The ".htaccess" file might be OK for public viewing, although if you have some server-specific configuration in there, the same principle applies.
</p>
