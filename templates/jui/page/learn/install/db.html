        <h1>Database</h1>
        <p>Agile Toolkit has a tight integration with MySQL. The development team decided to focus on a single database engine,
        but there are no architectural restrictions in the framework to using other databases. Although only MySQL is currently
        supported, our move to PDO will ensure wider compatibility with other databases in the future.</p>

        <p>MySQL is clearly the most successful companion to PHP applications, and it provides all the features
        a typical Web application uses. You can still use Agile Toolkit with other databases, at your own
        risk.</p>

        <h2>Configuring access</h2>
        <p>The definition of the format of an SQL connection string goes back to the old days of 2000 and is based on the 
        DB::Lite format of DSN. Here is a typical connection string - which is normally placed inside your config.php:</p>
<?Code?>
$config['dsn']='mysql://user:password@localhost/dbname';

// define port:
// $config['dsn']='mysql://user:password:8888@localhost/dbname';

// through socket
// $config['dsn']='mysql://user:password:/tmp/sock@localhost/dbname';
<?/Code?>

        <h3>Defining Access through an Array</h3>
        <p>If the DSN string is impossible to define - for example, if your password contains the '@' character - then this
        alternative format is preferred:</p>

<?Code?>
$config['dsn']=array(
    'hostspec'=>'localhost:1234',
    'username'=>'dbuser',
    'password'=>'secret'
);
        
// Arguments passed to mysql_connect as
// mysql_connect('localhost:1234','dbuser','secret');
<?/Code?>

        <h2>Establishing a Connection</h2>
        <p>To establish a connection with the database you should add the following command either inside the init() method
        of the API or of the page:</p>
        
<?Code?>
$this->api->dbConnect();
<?/Code?>

        <p>Establishing a connection and selecting the database takes some time, so if your application is not database-intensive,
         placing this statement into only the pages - or even views - that need it might be a good idea.</p>

        <p>Even if called several times, the database connection will be established only once. Therefore if you need a separate or
         different database connection - for instance, because you want to run a test suite against a different database - you need 
         to establish a new database connection using separate configuration settings, manually:</p>
<?Code?>
$this->api->dbConnect($this->api->getConfig('dsn_testing'));
<?/Code?>

        <h3>SQL Access from Views</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit was one of the first web frameworks to implement dynamic queries, in 2003. DSQL is a very
        important component of Agile Toolkit, and it is used by many View objects. In contrast, views in other frameworks rely on
        an ORM to perform data operations, unnecessarily introducing the complexity of a data-layer abstraction to what is often 
        a simple operation.</p>

        <p>To explain this in simple terms, I will use the Form class as an example. You can use the $form->setSource('table'); method 
        on the form, which will make it fetch field data directly from database.</p>
<?Code?>
$form=$page->add('Form');
$form->addField('line','name');
$form->addField('line','surname');
$form->setSource('user');
$form->setCondition('id',123);
<?/Code?>
        
        <p>Views can cary their own DSQL object, which they use in specific ways. Usually this object is accessible through $object->dq,
        and you can manipulate it - this is actually what "Models" do in Agile Toolkit. When used with a Form, a Model will
        initialize fields in the Form for you, and will manipulate the Form's DSQL, according to the configuration of the model.</p>

        <p>If you wish to use an object with a different database - ie., for the purpose of dependency-injection - you should
        manually create $object->dq.</p>

        <h3>Debugging Database Queries</h3>
        <p>To make any DSQL object expose its queries, execute the debug() method:</p>
<?Code?>
$form->dq->debug();
<?/?>
        <p>This will output the queries to the screen. A properly written View will not perform any queries in its init()
        method, but will perform them during its rendering phase.</p>
