        <h1>Installing Required Software for Agile Toolkit</h1>

        <p>Before you start learning Agile Toolkit, we advise you to have it insstalled on your local computer. Alternatively
        you can use a standalone web-server, however in our guides we will be assuming, that you can access your local
        webserver at http://localhost/</p>

        <p>We suggest you to use one of the Apache+PHP+MySQL bundles, which are available for any operating system. For 
        example, if you are on windows, download and install WAMP. Of course there are alternatives, which you can also
        use. You would need to have PHP verison 5.2, however we recommend to use 5.3+.</p>

        <p>While developing in Agile Toolkit, you woul be creating a lot of *.php files. You should get a good text editor,
        such as Notepad++ for Windows or Coda for Mac OSX.</p>

        <p>All the software here is free and can be downloaded from the following links:</p>
