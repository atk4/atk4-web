        <h1>Installing Agile Toolkit for the first time</h1>
        <p>Download Agile Toolkit from <a href="http://agiletoolkit.org">agiletoolkit.org</a> and unpack it into
        webroot. If you area already using webroot for something else, you can pick any other sub-directory. The
        file you just downloaded called atk4-example.zip combines 3 things: Agile Toolkit, Add-ons and a very
        simple example project structure.</p>

        <p>Open index.php file in your browser and you should see "Hello World from your own copy of Agile Toolkit".
        For your convenience, here is a sample installation on our server: <a href="http://example.agiletoolkit.org/">
        http://example.agiletoolkit.org/</a>

        If this works, then you are ready to proceed to the next step.
        <h3>Upgrading Agile Toolkit</h3>
        <p><a href="<?page?>download<?/?>">Go to "download" page</a> and pick "atk4-x.x.zip" and "atk4-addons.x.x.zip".
        Expand those archives and move "atk4" and "atk4-addons" directories replacing the ones already present in your
        installation.</p>

        <h3>Alternative Installation</h3>

        <p>If you are using Linux, then you probably already have Apache installed. You can also use more complex
        configurations such as Nginx + PHP-FMP or lighttpd for improved performance.</p>

        <h3>Git</h3>
        <p>If you are well familiar with Git, you can "clone" atk4-example instead of downloading it. Alternatively
        you can create your own repository and attach atk4 and atk4-addons as submodules.</a>

<?Code?>
$ git clone git://github.com/atk4/atk4-example
$ cd atk4-example
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
<?/?>

        <h3>Server Deployment</h3>

        <p>Finally, if you are looking to share your web application with others, we suggest you to use Platform as
        a Service offering PHP hosting in the cloud. It will take care of your project deployment for you and will let
        you focus on development. Agile Toolkit is tested and should work with most PHP platforms. Two deployment platforms
        which we recommend are:
