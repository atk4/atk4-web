        <h1>The Configuration File</h1>
        <p>Agile Toolkit uses a PHP array for defining configuration. The file config-default.php and config.php then
        add more properties into the $config array variable, which is copied into the API during file inclusion. Below is a
        sample of a config.php file.</p>

        <p>Like many other things, configuration options are optional in config.php. This is just a sample, and you
        should add lines as you require.</p>

<?Code?>
$config['dsn']='mysql://user:secret@localhost/db';

$config['sample']['setting']=123;

$config['billing']['realex']['merchantid']='merchant';
$config['billing']['realex']['account']='';
$config['billing']['realex']['secret']='secret';

$config['logger']['log_output'] = 'full';
$config['logger']['log_dir'] = 'logs';
<?/Code?>

        <p>The method api->getConfig('sample/setting',400); is used to to retrieve config settings. The second argument
        to this function is a default value, and it's used extensively throughout Agile Toolkit add-ons and components.
        </p>
        <h2>Loading Additional Config Files</h2>
        <p>By default Agile Toolkit will read the config.php and config-defaults.php files. The settings in config.php will override the settings in config-defaults.php. The files are loaded by the Api using the readConfig() method. You can, therefore, load configurations from additional files yourself, using the same method.</p>
<?Code?>
$this->api->readConfig('config-extra.php');
<?/?>
        <p>The file config-distrib.php is never loaded. It is a "template" that you can use to make your own copy of config.php. The Agile Toolkit Installation Guide will typically suggest that you copy "config-distrib.php" and rename it to "config.php". You can then edit its contents. When you upgrade your Agile Toolkit installation, the upgrade will not write over your customised config.php file.</p>
