        <h1>Getting Examples to work</h1>
        <p>All the documentation of Agile Toolkit is filled with numerous examples. What's really exciting is that
        examples are executed right in the documentation and you can actually see what each code sinppet
        produces. Here is an example:</p>

<?Example?>
$button=$page->add('Button')
    ->setLabel('Button')
    ->js('click')
        ->univ()
        ->alert('My First Button');
<?/?>

        <p>First, let's make sure you can execute this example in your local copy of Agile Toolkit. Select the
        code and "copy" it with Ctrl+C (Cmd+C on Mac). Then open file located in page/index.php and place
        it inside "init" method.</p>

        <p>Refresh your browser window and you should see now your new button on your page.</p>

        <h3>How does that work?</h3>
        <p>With Agile Toolkit, your code is separated from the "look and feel". That's why you didn't need to worry about how
        button will appear in your browser. Most probably the way how it looks in your local installation
        of Agile Toolkit is different to this documentation, your button might not be green at all.</p>

        <p>That is because button class has it's own template, and template on aglietoolkit.org is different
        to the one you are using. Actually the CSS part is different, unless you are designer too, you wouldn't
        need to know this.</p>
