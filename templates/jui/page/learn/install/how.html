        <h1>Getting Examples to work</h1>
        <p>All of the Agile Toolkit documentation is filled with numerous examples. What's really exciting is that
        examples are executed right in the documentation and you can actually see what each code sinppet
        produces. Here is an example:</p>

<?Example?>
$button=$page->add('Button')
    ->setLabel('Button')
    ->js('click')
        ->univ()
        ->alert('My First Button');
<?/?>

        <p>First, let's make sure you can execute this example in your local copy of Agile Toolkit. Select the
        code and "copy" it with Ctrl+C (Cmd+C on Mac). Then open the file located in page/index.php, and place
        it inside the "init" method.</p>

        <p>Refresh your browser window and you should now see your new button on your page.</p>

        <h3>How does that work?</h3>
        <p>With Agile Toolkit, your code is separated from the "look and feel" of the page. That's why you didn't need to worry about how
        the button will appear in your browser. Most probably the way it looks in your local installation
        of Agile Toolkit is different to the way it does in this online documentation - your button might not be green at all.</p>

        <p>That is because the button class has its own template, and the template used in agiletoolkit.org is different
        to the one you are using. Actually, it is the CSS file that is different - but unless you are designer, too, you wouldn't
        need to know this.</p>
