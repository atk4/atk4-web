    <p>As you have already learned in <a href="<?page?>learn/intro<?/?>">Objects and Web</a>, Agile Toolkit is a fully
    Object-Oriented environment and implements everything as objects. There are 5 types of objects - Application, Page,
    Model, View and Controller.</p>

    <p>This section will give you the opportunity to dip into each of these types. However, before we do that, let's start
    with some basics.</p>

    <h3>Geeky Introduction</h3>
    <p>If you think in different frameworks, or if you have vast programming experience with different platforms and are a wiz at Object Oriented programming; I have
    prepared a special section for you. It uses a much more complex language but will explain things much more precise.</p>
