        <p>As you have already read in <a href="<?page?>learn/intro<?/?>">Objects and Web</a>, Agile Toolkit is a fully
        Object-Oriented environment and implements everything as objects. There are 5 types of objects - Application, Page,
        Model, View and Controller.</p>

        <p>This section will give you the opportunity to dip into each of these types. However, before we do that, let's learn some 
        things which apply to all of the code: the basics.</p>

        <h3>Don't over-think it!</h3>
        <p>Many experienced developers make the mistake of trying to think too much. How is the rendering done? How is form data submitted? How is AJAX used? Let go of those worries, and leave it to Agile Toolkit. Focus on your task. Keep it simple.</p>

        <p>If you are not entirely happy without knowing the minor details, you can learn them later. Anything you can do in conventional web development can also be done in Agile Toolkit, although the way you do it might be different.</p>
