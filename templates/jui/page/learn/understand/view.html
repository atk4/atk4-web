        <h1>Views</h1>
        <p>A View is an object in Agile Toolkit which knows how to render itself. Some examples of Views are "button", "form",
        "lorem ipsum", "menu" etc.</p>

        <p>By default, a View relies on a template engine to produce its output. Views can contain other views. All Views in
        Agile Toolkit contain many useful features.</p>
