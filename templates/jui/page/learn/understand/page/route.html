        <h1>How Agile Toolkit translates the URL into a Page</h1>
        <p>In Agile Toolkit, pages are handled by special objects instantiated with the Page class. Any page has a name to
        which it will respond. Usually a page object is automatically initialized by the API, along with all the objects
        on that page.</p>

        <p>You might have noticed, how we were adding objects to a Page in previous chapters, using $page. This variable refers to the
        current page object. In reality, you would probably would put the code directly into page/index.php, which
        defines the class page_index. All objects you want to see on this page should be added to its init() method.</p>

        <p>A Page object is also derived from AbstractView. All you need to do is define page classes. Do not
        manually add page objects, the API will do this for you. But how does API knows which page class to use?</p>

        <h3>Page Routing</h3>
        <p>By default, Agile Toolkit uses a front-controller approach. All the requests are captured and executed
        in the same way, by mod_rewrite, and routed through index.php, which creates and executes the API. The API relies on a specific
        component called a PageManager. The job of PageManager is to determine the name of the Page Class from the URL used.</p>

        <p>The actual logic is always quite intuitive. Look at the following page for examples:</p>
<div class="box blue-noised p-10px">
	<div class="white">
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Browser URL</th>
					<th>Page</th>
					<th width="50%">Notes</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/preferences.html</td>
				<td>preferences</td>
				<td>Agile Toolkit completely ignores the extension and uses remaining location to determine page name.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/index.php?page=user/add</td>
				<td>user/add</td>
				<td>Your default install of Agile Toolkit is not configured to use mod_rewrite. Therefore the URL in the browser will
                appear with index.php in front of it. Passing page=XX will always override the page name, which is very useful
                in building beautiful URLs</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/profile/change-password.do</td>
				<td>profile/changepassword</td>
				<td>Dashes cannot be used in a function or class, they are eliminated from the page name automatically. Any
                extension can be used as long as .htaccess directs them to index.php</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/?abc=123</td>
				<td>index</td>
				<td>If URL does not contain page, then "index" page name is used.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/admin/logout</td>
				<td>logout</td>
				<td>Most often site administration is implemented as a separate site with another entry point (directory). Pages are
                relative to the installation point (directory).</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

        <h3>URL Components</h3>

        <p>PageManager splits the URL in your location bar into 3 parts:

        <ol><li>base_url</li>
        <li>base_path</li>
        <li>page</li></ol>
       
        $api->pm->base_url points to the web-server of your
        web application, such as http://yoursite.com:81. The next part - $api->pm->base_path - points to the root page of
        your web software. For example, if you unpack the software in webroot/test/app then
        base_path="/test/app/". base_path always starts and ends with slash.</p>

        <p>The final part is called "page" and it's a relative location within your web application. The top-most page is called
        the "index" page. The page you are looking at right now is called "learn/understand/page" and it is calculated from the url:
        <?page?>.<?/?>.</p>

        <p>The page follows the standard object pattern, and executes the init() method after it's initialized. A Page may have a custom template,
        but if it does not, the default page layout is used to display an empty page.</p>
