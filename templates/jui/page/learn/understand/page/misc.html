        <h2>Keeping Your Functionality Scalable</h2>
        <p>Scalability is the ability to grow without facing hindering limitations. When the functionality of the application
        increases or changes, a poorly planned and maintained project will encounter severe problems.</p>

        <p>The two major cures against the curse of "spaghetti code" are a decent framework and refactoring. Refactoring
        implies moving from one file to another.</p>

        <h3>Avoid using API methods to define pages</h3>
        <p>In mature web software the API class reaches around 1000 lines of code, and is contains application-related logic.
        Having page definitions in the same file makes it increasingly difficult to work with it. It's suggested that from the start
        you should use a class-based approach to define pages in your software.</p>

        <h3>Extend page classes</h3>
        <p>If you have had proper training in Object-Oriented development, you should know that making similar pages inherit
        from a common parent might be a good idea. For instance, you may have 2 preference pages for 2 different types of users, but
        the structure and objects on those pages might be similar enough to share them through OOP.</p>
        <p>In this case, create a lib/Page/Preferences.php parent class, then extend it twice, customising the child classes as you 
        find appropriate. Because the class is inside "lib" and not "page" it won't be accessible directly through a URL.</p>
        <p>Alternatively you can put the parent class into page/preferences.php and define it as "abstract". Between those two
        approaches, the first one is recommended, because the "not found" case will be properly handled.</p>



        <h2>Upper and Lower Cases</h2>
        <p>If you are developing on Windows or Mac, you use a case-insensitive operating system. However, always assume that
        your deployment platform will be case-sensitive. Page classes always start with "page" and follow this pattern:
        "page_user_preferences_twitter" where underscores correspond with their directory structure. When placed inside "lib",
        classes use CamelCase such as "Page_FileManager", however here they can use underscores to define areas or zones as well as
        inheritance, eg: "Page_User_Settings".</p>

        <h2>Use of Slashes Versus Underscores</h2>
        <p>If you have a page_user_preferences_twitter page class, it can be accessed as either 'user_preferences_twitter' or
        'user/preferences/twitter'. Link building will work properly regardless of which you use, however if you are
        using slashes with mod_rewrite and your own template, you may encounter issues with relative image/css paths. Proper
        use of &lt;?template?&gt; tags inside your templates will help you avoid this problem.
