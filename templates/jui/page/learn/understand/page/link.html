        <h1>Building URLs</h1>
        <p>Since there are quite a few different ways to configure URLs in Agile Toolkit, there is also a way to produce
        links. For example, if you want to figure out how the URL would look for the page 'preferences/user', you can use
        one of the following methods:
<?Example?>
$url=$page->api
    ->getDestinationURL('preferences/user');

$page->add('P')->set('URL is '.$url);
$page->add('P')->set('Absolute URL is '.
    $url->useAbsoluteURL());
<?/?>

        <p>You might have noticed that $url is actually an object, which can also be used as a string.</p>

        <p>To pass information between pages, a convenient way is to use arguments in the URL, as in a GET form request. 
        If you wish to complicate things by creating URLs such as /book/39/delete you are free to spend some time building
        them, however in most cases such presentation might not be important. Agile Toolkit provides a convenient way to pass
        arguments as GET URLs to any page:</p>

<?Example?>
$url=$page->api
    ->getDestinationURL('search',
            array('q'=>'my book'));

$page->add('P')->set('URL is '.$url);
$page->add('P')->set('Absolute URL is '.
    $url->useAbsoluteURL());
<?/?>

        <p>GET URL Arguments are always properly escaped / encoded. Setting an argument's value to "false" or "null" will exclude it
        from the list of arguments.</p>

        <h3>Sticky GET Arguments</h3>
        <p>Sometimes our page will receive an argument which it shouldn't forget. Agile Toolkit allows you to mark some
        GET arguments as "sticky", which means they will be passed on to all generated URLs automatically.</p>

        <p>In the following example, if a "user" GET argument is passed to the page, this argument will be included in all
        subsequently generated URLs. Positioning of the stickyGET() call is important. The effect of stickyGET can be undone by
        calling stickyForget, although normally you wouldn't need to do it.</p>

<?Example?>
$page->api->stickyGET('user');

$url=$page->api
    ->getDestinationURL('search',
            array('q'=>'my book'));

$para=$page->add('P')->set('URL is '.$url.
        ' but same URL without user '.
        $url->set('user',false));

$page->api->stickyForget('user');


$page->add('Button')->setLabel('Refresh paragraph')
    ->js('click',
        $para->js()->reload(array('user'=>123)));

<?/?>

        <h3>Relative Pages</h3>
        <p>Another handy feature in Agile Toolkit is the ability to generate URLs from relative paths.</p>
<div class="box blue-noised p-10px">
	<div class="white">
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Page</th>
					<th>Generated URL</th>
					<th width="50%">Notes</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>/</td>
				<td><?page?>/<?/?></td>
				<td>Using "/" generates URL to index page.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>.</td>
				<td><?page?>.<?/?></td>
				<td>Single dot refers to the current page. You can also pass "null" as 1st argument to getDestinationURL to
                assume current page</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>..</td>
				<td><?page?>..<?/?></td>
				<td>Parent page in page hierarchy.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>../object</td>
				<td><?page?>../object<?/?></td>
				<td>Adjacent page is specified as a sub-page of the parent page.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>./test</td>
				<td><?page?>./test<?/?></td>
				<td>Finally you can link to a sub-page of a current page like this.</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</div>
</div>


    <h3>Try your own examples</h3>


<?Example?>
$form=$page->add('Form');
$in=$form->addField('line','page');
$out=$form->addfield('line','relative_url');

$in->js(true)->univ()
    ->autoChange(200)->disableEnter();
$in->js('change',$form->js()->submit());

$form->onSubmit(function($form) use($out){
    return $out->js()->val(
        $form->api->getDestinationURL(
            $form->get('page')));
});

<?/?>
        <p>As you might have noticed, no extra checks or escaping is performed on the page name. You should never display
        a link, where the user may directly affect the "page". It is, however, perfectly secure to pass user-supplied data through
        GET arguments.</p>
