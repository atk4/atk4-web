<h1>Learning should be fun!</h1>

        <p>While you are trying to learn Agile Toolkit, let's keep it fun and informal. But first - the good news:</p>

        <h3>Examples are as easy as they look</h3>

        <p>Have you seen those blogs which teach you how to do things,but you need to create 5 files and do multiple tweaks, before finally being able to see any result?</p>

        <p>Examples in Agile Toolkit documentation are <b>straight forward</b>. They are short and compact. Apart from Agile Toolkit, you don't need to have anything else. If you have gone through the installation documentation, you will know <a href="<?page?>learn/install/how<?/?>">where to put your example code</a>.</p>
        </p>

        <p>Do not hesitate to copy-paste any example into your local installation of Agile Toolkit. You'll find out that button shape, layout or font-size may differ to match the configuration of your own environment, but the result and logic will remain the same</p>

        <p><b>Important:</b> Be sure to use proper upper/lower case for your files and classes.</p>
        <p><b>Important:</b> If an example asks you to create a view/test.php file, create a "view" folder if it does not exist.</p>
        <p><b>Important:</b> When creating PHP files, be sure to add <b>&lt;?php</b> at the start.</p>
