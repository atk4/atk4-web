        <h1>Understanding API Classes</h1>

        <p>Agile Toolkit does not use any static elements or global variables. The only global variable you use in the
        "index.php" class is "$api". All additional classes are added into your API, or into other objects inside the API.</p>

        <p>This leads to several interesting points:
        <ul>
        <li>You can have more than one API running at the same time;</li>
        <li>APIs are independent, and will never share same ID, Cookie name or session name;</li>
        <li>You can create one API from inside another one, but the latter won't be able to access the former;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Controllers versus Singletons</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit does not use singletons. Singletons do not provide any performance or persistence benefits in
        PHP5.2 or higher. Instead, Agile Toolkit has the concept of "Controllers". A controller can be added into an object, but a
        controller of a certain type can only be added to a certain object once. This is a "soft" restriction: you can still add second 
        controller of same type to the same object at your own risk, if you specify a different name for it.</p>

        <p>For example: you can add a "Logger" controller into the API, which enhances the way errors are displayed. Adding another Logger
        into the API again will do nothing, and will simply return a reference to your existing Logger.</p>

        <p>Because it's possible to have multiple APIs at the same time, this opens up new strategies for testing. For
        instance, a 'testing' API can initialize your 'real' API. Before executing a test, the 'test' API can destroy() some of the
        controllers in the 'real' API, and replace them with new ones. This implements a dependency-injection based testing framework, which
        is really close to the real-life environment of your application.</p>


        <h3>Realms</h3>
        <p>When the API class is initialized it expects only one argument: the "realm". A Realm must be unique to an
        application or even to an installation. The realm becomes the "name" of your $api, and it will also be used in all unique IDs
        (cookies, DOM id's, session variables).</p>

        <p>Through combining the concept of multiple APIs with proper realms, you can implement some unique features - such as a "Login As
        User" feature, by actually using the frontend API and calling the "login" method of its auth object.</p>
