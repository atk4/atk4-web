        <h1>Database Considerations</h1>
        <p>By designing your database in a certain way, you can save yourself some time and some trouble. Agile Toolkit makes certain assumptions about the names and types of fields. If you follow the guidelines below, creation of your models will be simpler. Otherwise, you might need to do some tweaking.</p>

<h3>ID Column</h3>
<p>For every table create an ID field: numeric, preferably auto-incremental, and named exactly "id". </p>
<div class="atk_doc example"><code><pre>
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ...
);
</pre></code></div>

<?MoreInfo?>What if I can't?
<p>There are number of problems. For example, column editing with a Grid will not be as easy, since they rely on the presence of an "id" column. You will need to alias your id field through $grid->dq->field('other_id id');</p>
<p>Models do not fully support ID fields named differently. Actually, models do support them, but the relations will give you problems. You would need to avoid using refModel(), and would need to define calculated fields manually if your table is joined with other tables via non-'id' fields.</p>
<p>Use of tables with differently named 'id' fields is not impossible, but will present a number of challenges.</p>

<h3>Foreign keys</h3>
<p>Agile Toolkit handles foreign keys quite well, however you should remember to name foreign keys by building their name from the foreign table name and the _id postfix. For example: if table1 needs reference to table2, then table1.table2_id = table2.id would be the join condition.</p>

<div class="atk_doc example"><code><pre>
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    ...
  `user_id` INT(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  KEY `fk_mytable_user1` (`user_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `fk_mytable_user1` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `user` (`id`)
    ...
);
</pre></code></div>

<h3>Special fields</h3>
<p>Some fields have special meanings, if defined. "name" will be used if you cast model into string or use it inside a dropdown, or through references. If the "name" field is not defined, then you'll see something like 'mytable #23' where 23 is the record ID.</p>
<h3>Soft-delete and Audit</h3>
<p>If you excute $this->defineAuditFields(), the model will register 4 fields: "created_dts", "updated_dts", "deleted_dts" and "deleted".</p>
<p>Those fileds will be automatically filled-in on creation, update and deletion operations. If a "deleted" field is defined for a model, it will be used as a boolean for soft delete. That means that instead of physically deleting your record, $model->delete() will only mark it with deleted="Y".</p>

<h3>Booleans</h3>
<p>The field type "boolean" in Agile Toolkit is saved as either 'Y' or 'N' in the database. Creating a char(1) field or enum('Y','N') is the most common. It is also typical for boolean fields to be named starting with "is_".</p>
<div class="atk_doc example"><code><pre>
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    ...
  `is_active` ENUM('Y','N') DEFAULT 'N',
    ...
);
</pre></code></div>

<h3>Money</h3>
<p>Typically money would need to be stored in DECIMAL(8,2), or something similar.</p>
<div class="atk_doc example"><code><pre>
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    ...
  `balance` DECIMAL(8,2),
    ...
);
</pre></code></div>

<h3>Dates</h3>
<p>Date operations with SQL always use the format: 'yyyy-mm-dd'. Views can then change the format of the date field, but it's stored via SQL in exactly this format.</p>

<h3>Encoding and Collations</h3>
<p>Agile Toolkit does not have any preferences towards charsets, although if you are setting up a database from scratch, use utf8_general_ci or utf8_unicode_ci and not latin1. </p>
<div class="atk_doc example"><code><pre>
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    ...
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
</pre></code></div>

<h3>Field cases and special characters</h3>
<p>Although you can use different cases and special characters in field names, and perhaps even table names - by surrounding them with tick marks: `my field` - this might not play well with Agile Toolkit. In most cases, Agile Toolkit will escape those names, but there might be some complications.</p>
