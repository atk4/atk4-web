        <h1>Calculated Fields</h1>
        <p>So far we have only defined the init() method. However, we now have some calculated fields to define, which will require their own functions. Here is our updated model class:</p>

<?Code?>
class Model_Book extends Model_Table {
    public $entity_code='book';
    public $table_alias='b';
    function init(){
        parent::init();
        $this->addField('name');
        $this->addField('isbn')->mandatory(true);
        $this->addField('publisher_id')->refModel('Publisher');
        $this->addField('author_id')->refModel('Author');

        $this->addField('copies_borrowed')->type('int')->calculated(true);
        $this->addField('copies_in_stock')->type('int')->calculated(true);
    }

    function calculate_copies_borrowed(){
        $dq=$this->add('Model_Book_Borrower')->dsql();
        $dq->where('bb.book_id = b.id');
        $dq->field('count(*)');
        return $dq;
    }

    function calculate_copies_in_stock(){
        $dq_total=$this->add('Model_Book_Stock')->dsql();
        $dq->where('bb.book_id = b.id');
        $dq->field('count(*)');

        return $dq.' - '.$this->calculate_copies_borrowed();
    }

}
<?/?>
        <p>Certainly a lot of magic here.</p>

        <h3>Building queries from models</h3>
        <p>Models can export a dynamic query when you call $model->dsql(). This query will have a proper table and table alias set, but will also contain joins and conditions. It is essential that you learn to rely on this method whenever possible. Once you learn to use it efficiently, you will save yourself a lot of trouble.</p>

        <p>For example, consider that the model "Borrower" has been changed, and a new flag has been added: "is_book_returned". Now, instead of deleting the record, a flag must be set in this field. You will want to define this condition inside the Model_Borrower::init() function, which will automatically add it to the query exported by dsql().</p>

        <p>As a result the count field will be properly and securely associated with only the right amount of borrowers.</p>

        <h3>Combining queries</h3>
        <p>Dynamic queries transform themselves into "select" when they are used as string content. Our next function for calculating how many copies are in stock needs to know how many copies we have in total, then subtract the borrowed ones. As you can see, in a similar way we build a sub-select for calculating the total amount of books, then subtracting the other calculated field from it.</p>

        <p>Again this is great for consistency in your business logic, and is much better than writing your queries manually.</p>

        <h2>Using your own expressions in calculated fields</h2>
        <p>You can also manually provide any SQL for calculated fields:</p>
<?Code?>
function calculate_my_field(){
    return "other_field+2";
}
<?/?>

    </div>
