        <h1>Introduction to Models</h1>

        <p>Models describe your real business entities in a very object-oriented way. Models implement Active Record functionality, as well as Dynamic Queries for multi-record actions.</p>


<?MoreInfo?>Why not use a 3rd party ORM?
<p>The design of Models in other ORMs such as Propel and Doctrine focuses mainly on cross-database implementation of SQL requests. The Models in Agile Toolkit focus on consistency of business logic and security features.</p>

<p>Models in Agile Toolkit are simpler. You can define one with a regular PHP class, do not need to generate any of the code or learn a new model definition file format. Models like this are much more suitable for inheritance. In the same application you could have: User, Administrator, Client, Client_Banned models, which internally use the same "user" table, but contain different field definitions, conditions or even joins.</p>

<p>Security is one of the benefits of Agile Toolkit models. When your CRUD operates with a "Client_Banned" model, it will only be able to create entries of this model in the database. Some other restrictions can also be defined on a model level, such as a restriction so the user cam only access their own record in the database, and not those belonging to other users.</p>

<p>Very often models in Agile Toolkit have more functionality and incorporate logic normally found in Controllers in other frameworks. This is because "Controllers" in Agile Toolkit are generic.</p>

<p>The UI stack knows how to link with Models directly, therefore quite often all you need to do is to specify a proper model. The Agile Toolkit Model also contains some additional information about fields such as "caption", "system flag" etc.</p>

<p>Business-logic validation is often handled by the model. The User Interface performs validation through AJAX requests, so it's consistent, not duplicated, and not carried outside of the server-side code. If more developers start working on your software, you will want some of them to focus on Models, others on User Interface.</p>

<p>You will find that Models are sufficient to define the content of your Forms, will bind with custom templates, and will be handy to use even in complex situations - and are a great way to export an API from your system with very little extra effort.</p>

        <h2>What can a Model on its own?</h2>
        <p>See some examples of syntactic sugar of Models</p>

<?Code?>
// Initialize object for employee
$emp=$this->add('Model_Employee');

// Load data for a given id
$emp->loadData($_GET['id']);

// Interact with data
$salary = $emp->get('salary');

// Traverse foreign keys. Automatically loads proper model and data
$company=$emp->getRef('company_id');

// a Model can define custom actions.
$company->letGo($emp);

// Standard actions can also be used
$emp->delete();

// Same Model_Employee, but adds condition/master field
$emps = $company->getEmployees();

// a Model can produce dynamic queries for any actions
$count = $emps->dsql()->field('count(*)')->do_getOne();

// You can use a customized model to create a fully functional CRUD
// If you add employee through a CRUD they will become company
// employees automatically.
$this->add('CRUD')->setModel($emps);

        <h4>Direct use of Models</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Define all the fields of the model and the type of those fields</li>
        <li>Completely define model-related business logic inside the model body</li>
        <li>Provide and encourage inheritance of models: User, ExpiredUser, AdminUser etc</li>
        <li>Implement dependencies between models as well as traversal</li>
        <li>When it comes to SQL, the model can use either single or multiple tables to store data (joins)</li>
        <li>Provide the ability for the model to add mandatory conditions to SQL tables</li>
        <li>Track which fields are changed</li>
        <li>Encourage model-level validation and default values</li>
        <li>Allow adding behaviours, either manually inside model functions or as extensions</li>
        <li>Support SQL calculated fields</li>
        <li>Offer extensions such as strong encryptions, audit log, timestamps, soft delete, and so on</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Interface integration features</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Bind Form with Model. It will populate field, validation, conditions and will offer to save form data automatically through model</li>
        <li>Bind Grid with Model. Displays properly formatted fields, both physical, calculated, foreign and related</li>
        <li>Define which fields and in which order you want to show when binding</li>
        <li>Add more fields, more conditions or even remove fields before you bind with the view</li>
        <li>Use custom controller when binding. This can allow you to bind a view to multiple models</li>
        <li>Validation exceptions inside models bubble up to the view and are properly handled</li>
        <li>After binding with model, tweak dynamic SQL statement even more, such as by joining to more tables</li>
        <li>4.2: Will have support for MongoDB, Prepared query cache, Data/Memcached, PDO (PostreSQL, Oracle, SQLite) and parametric queries</li>
        </ul>
