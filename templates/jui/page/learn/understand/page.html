        <h1>Pages, Objects and Links</h1>
        <p>The web is greatly inspired on books. Similar to a book, the most fundamental part of the web is a "page". A Page is
        a collection of related objects and links. Links would usually lead to other pages, while objects may dynamically
        interact with the user while he remains on the same page.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit relies on similar concepts. Ultimately, your project will consist of pages, and each page will
        consist of static information, links and objects.</p>
