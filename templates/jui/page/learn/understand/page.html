    <h1>Pages, Objects and Links</h1>
    <p>The web is greatly inspired by books. Similar to a book, the most fundamental part of the web is a "page". When user clicks
    a link on the page, he expect to find himself on a different page. When "Back" button is clicked, user returns to the previous
    page.</p>

    <p>Each page may contain a number of dynamic elements, which on their own may have a state and dynamic interaction with the user.
    Such elements are always described on the same page and must not communicate with other pages.</p>

    <p>Agile Toolkit automatically decides which page needs to be loaded. Each page is represented as a class and will be loaded from
    a file such as page/index.php. You as developer can add other objects on the page. Designer can change the template of the page
    creating custom layouts and adding static text where necessary.</p>
