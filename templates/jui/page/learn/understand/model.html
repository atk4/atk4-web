        <h1>Models</h1>
        <p>Models are yet another gem of Agile Toolkit. The implementation of Models in Agile Toolkit is lightweight and very intuitive - and provides an elegant way for you to define your business logic.</p>

        <p>If you have used ORMs before, you will probably find Agile Toolkit Models more 'self-sufficient', often incorporating some of the controller logic. The Models in your application are designed to help keep your objects securely separated and organised.</p>

        <p>The use of Models in Agile Toolkit is optional, but very highly recommended for anything more sophisticated than a contact form.</p>
