    <h1>Models</h1>
    <p>Models are yet another gem of Agile Toolkit. The implementation of Models in Agile Toolkit is specifically flexible and is well suited for application scalability.</p>

    <p>In practice Models implement a unique ORM and Active Record functionality. Agile Toolkit can work with other ORMs but you would need to write your own Controllers. Native implementaiton can automatically populate form fields, column grids, etc</p>

    <p>Agile Toolkit separates Basic models and Relational (SQL) Models.</p>
