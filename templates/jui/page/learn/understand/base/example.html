        <h1>Power of Object Oriented Web Development</h1>
        <p>Agile Toolkit is inspired by the flexibility and power of desktop UI frameworks but is also specifically desiged
        to be lightweight enough for high performance on the web. For many years PHP community haven't seen a real potential
        of object oriented design primarily restricted by capabilities of older PHP verisons, compatibility as well as
        general mind-set of development community.</p>
        <p>This page will demonstrate some of the UI capabilities which applies to absolutely ANY object in Agile
        Toolkit using the following example.</p>

        <h2>The Job: "Slot Machine"</h2>
        <p>Suppose one day a curious client shows up and willing to put your skills to the test by paying you to develop a
        simple "slot machine". Client is not yet sure of what he needs, but he says he'll figure it out once he gets his
        hands on a first prototype. His requirements is to make a web page display 3 random digits to the visitor.</p>

        <p><i>"Simple enough"</i> you say and write a HTML for this curious task putting it into
        templates/default/view/slotmachine.html</p>
<pre>
 &lt;div id="&lt;?$_name?>" style="border: 2px solid black">
   &lt;div style="padding: 4px; border: 1px solid red">&lt;?$slot1?>&lt;/div>
   &lt;div style="padding: 4px; border: 1px solid red">&lt;?$slot2?>&lt;/div>
   &lt;div style="padding: 4px; border: 1px solid red">&lt;?$slot3?>&lt;/div>
 &lt;/div>
</pre>

        <p>Next think you'll do is to generate random numbers and place them into the template slots. This logic should be
        contained inside a new class file, which must be created inside lib/SlotMachine.php:</p>

<?Code?>
class View_SlotMachine extends AbstractView {
    function init(){
        parent::init();
        $this->template->set('slot1',rand(1,9));
        $this->template->set('slot2',rand(1,9));
        $this->template->set('slot2',rand(1,9));
    }
    function defaultTemplate(){
        return array('view/slotmachine');
    }
}
<?/?>
        <p>Excitedly you call your client and tell them that you have fineshed the job and ask him which page you need his
        View added. <i>"Add it to the index page"</i> he says, <i>"Let me know when you have done it, so that I can
        see"</i></p>

        <p>As you follow his instruction you open page/index.php and type the following inside init() method:</p>
<?Example?>
$page->add('View_SlotMachine');
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Yeah, YEAH!, good start. How about having 3 of them?"</i> — <i>"No problem"</i> you reply and 2 more lines</p>
<?Example?>
$page->add('View_SlotMachine');
$page->add('View_SlotMachine');
$page->add('View_SlotMachine');
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Naaaw, make it two. But put them alongside"</i> — he says. <i>"OK"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Now make left-one react to mouse. When I point mouse on it, I want backgroud to change"</i></p>
      
<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
$left->js('click')
    ->animate(array('background-color'=>'#F82'));
$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Hmm.. How about it changes color of the one on the right, not it's own?"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
$left->js('click',$right->js()
    ->animate(array('background-color'=>'#F82')));
<?/?>

        <p><i>"I think this leads us nowhere. Let's go back and try something else. Can you add a button to re-dial numbers?"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');

$page->add('Button')->setLabel('Pull')
    ->js('click',
      $left->js()->reload());
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Awesome. But how about using same button for both machines?"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');

$page->add('Button')->setLabel('Pull')
    ->js('click', array(
          $left->js()->reload(),
          $right->js()->reload(),
    ));
<?/?>

        <p><i>"OK, but can't they appear at the same time?"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');

$page->add('Button')->setLabel('Pull')
    ->js('click', $col->js()->reload());
<?/?>

        <p><i>"You make changes faster than I can think of them! I bet you can do anything even put one machine into another!"</i></p>


<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn()->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$left->add('View_SlotMachine',null,'after_slots');

$page->add('Button')->setLabel('Pull')
    ->js('click', $col->js()->reload());
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Oh you didn't need to actually do that, I was just teasing. Let me get back to you when my designer finishes
        HTML. Great Job!"</i></p>

        <h3>Making them happy</h3>
        <p>Most clients are demanding. If yours are not, you are lucky, but more often than not you would find yourself
        implementing something first, then adjusting it. Some would call it "agile software development", other call it
        "client being picky".</p>

        <h2>How Agile Toolkit saves your day?</h2>
        <p>As a forward-thinking developer, you probably are inerested in getting "most" for "least" amount of code. Without
        using it, you would find yourself either spending too much time implementing the widget, or being unable to implement
        all of your client requests over the phone.</p>

        <p>Even the simplest View in Agile Toolkit has a very sophisticated capabilities:
        <ul>
        <li>Ability to be displayed absolutely anywhere on the page, inside other object or in global template</li>
        <li>Can have default template or be used with other template specified when adding object</li>
        <li>Will have it's own globally unique name in $object->name</li>
        <li>Can memorize thing on object level and then recall them. $object->memorize()</li>
        <li>Apply jQuery actions immediately or on event: $object->js('click')->hide('slow');</li>
        <li>Insert other objects into your object</li>
        <li>Set controller or model with setController or setModel</li>
        <li>Access template directly through $object->template->set();</li>
        <li>Define object-level hooks (callbacks)</li>
        <li>Raise object-specific exceptions through throw $object->exception('ouch')</li>
        <li>Remove and destroy object without rendering: $object->destroy()</li>
        <li>Manipulate elements such $object->getElement('foo');</li>
        <li>Re-load object through AJAX, $object->js()->reload();</li></ul>

        <p>All what you have saw happening, was due to the power of AbstractView class. All views in agile toolkit are based
        upon this class. Which means you can add many of them on any page, change their template, adding JavaScript events
        for them and even make them interact with other objects and even reload themselves in a very <b>unified</b> way.</p>
