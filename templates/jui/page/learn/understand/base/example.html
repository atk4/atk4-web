        <h1>Agile Toolkit Workflow — Views</h1>
        <p>Agile Toolkit is inspired by the flexibility and power of desktop UI frameworks, but it is also specifically designed
        to be lightweight enough for high performance on the web. For many years the PHP community hasn't seen frameworks using the
        full potential of object oriented design, primarily of restrictions imposed by the capabilities of older PHP versions, 
        compatibility with legacy systems, as well as the general development mindset of the community.</p>
        <p>Using the following example we will demonstrate some of the UI capabilities which apply to absolutely ALL objects in the Agile
        Toolkit.</p>

        <h2>The Job: a "Slot Machine"</h2>
        <p>Suppose one day a curious client shows up and wants to put your skills to the test by paying you to develop a
        simple "slot machine". The client is not yet sure of what he needs, but he says he'll figure it out once he gets his
        hands on a first prototype. His requirements is to make a web page display 3 random digits to the visitor.</p>

        <p><i>"Simple enough"</i>, you say, and write some HTML for this curious task - putting it into
        templates/default/view/slotmachine.html</p>
<pre>
 &lt;div id="&lt;?$_name?>" style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px; width: 150px; margin: 10px;">
   &lt;p&gt;Slot Machine&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div style="padding: 4px; border: 1px solid red">&lt;?$slot1?>&lt;/div>
   &lt;div style="padding: 4px; border: 1px solid red">&lt;?$slot2?>&lt;/div>
   &lt;div style="padding: 4px; border: 1px solid red">&lt;?$slot3?>&lt;/div>
 &lt;/div>
</pre>

        <p>Next, you need to generate random numbers and place them into the template slots. This logic should be
        contained inside a new class file, which must be created inside lib/View/SlotMachine.php:</p>

<?Code?>
class View_SlotMachine extends AbstractView {
    function init(){
        parent::init();
        $this->template->set('slot1',rand(1,9));
        $this->template->set('slot2',rand(1,9));
        $this->template->set('slot3',rand(1,9));
    }
    function defaultTemplate(){
        return array('view/slotmachine');
    }
}
<?/?>
        <p>Excitedly you call your client and tell them that you have finished the job, and ask him in which page you need his
        View added. <i>"Add it to the index page"</i> he says, <i>"Let me know when you are done, so I can
        see it"</i></p>

        <p>You follow his instructions: you open page/index.php and type the following inside the init() method:</p>
<?Example?>
$page->add('View_SlotMachine');
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Yeah, YEAH!, good start. How about having 3 of them?"</i> — <i>"No problem"</i> you reply, and add 2 more lines</p>
<?Example?>
$page->add('View_SlotMachine');
$page->add('View_SlotMachine');
$page->add('View_SlotMachine');
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Naaaw, make it two. But put them next to each other"</i> — he says. <i>"OK"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Now make the left one react to the mouse. When I point to it with the mouse, I want the background to change."</i></p>
      
<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
$left->js('click')
    ->animate(array('background-color'=>'#F82'));
$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Hmm.. How about if it changes the color of the one on the right, instead of its own?"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
$left->js('click',$right->js()
    ->animate(array('background-color'=>'#F82')));
<?/?>

        <p><i>"I think this is getting us nowhere. Let's go back and try something else. Can you add a button to re-pick the numbers?"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');

$page->add('Button')->setLabel('Pull')
    ->js('click',
      $left->js()->reload());
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Awesome. But how about using the same button for both machines?"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');

$page->add('Button')->setLabel('Pull')
    ->js('click', array(
          $left->js()->reload(),
          $right->js()->reload(),
    ));
<?/?>

        <p><i>"OK, but can't they re-shuffle at the same time?"</i></p>

<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');

$page->add('Button')->setLabel('Pull')
    ->js('click', $col->js()->reload());
<?/?>

        <p><i>"You make changes faster than I can think them! I bet you can even put one machine into the other!"</i></p>


<?Example?>
$col=$page->add('Columns');
$left=$col->addColumn(5)->add('View_SlotMachine');
$right=$left->add('View_SlotMachine',null,'after_slots');

$page->add('Button')->setLabel('Pull')
    ->js('click', $col->js()->reload());
<?/?>

        <p><i>"Oh, you didn't need to actually do that, I was just kidding! Let me get back to you when my designer finishes
        the HTML. Great Job!"</i></p>

        <h3>Making them happy</h3>
        <p>Most clients are demanding. If yours are not, you are lucky, but more often than not you will find yourself
        implementing something first, then adjusting it again and again. Some would call it "agile software development", others
        call it "a client being picky".</p>

        <h2>How Agile Toolkit saves your day</h2>
        <p>As a forward-thinking developer, you are probably interested in getting "the most" for "the least" amount of code. Without
        using Agile Toolkit, you may find yourself either spending too much time implementing a widget, or being unable to implement
        all of your client requests over the phone.</p>

        <p>Even the simplest View in Agile Toolkit has very sophisticated capabilities:
        <ul>
        <li>The ability to be displayed absolutely anywhere on the page, inside other objects or in global templates</li>
        <li>It can have a default template, or can be used with another template, specified when adding the object</li>
        <li>It will have its own globally unique name in $object->name</li>
        <li>It can memorize properties on the object level, and then recall them: $object->memorize()</li>
        <li>It can apply jQuery actions immediately, or on a specific event: $object->js('click')->hide('slow');</li>
        <li>It allows you to insert other objects into your view object</li>
        <li>It allows you to link a controller or model with setController or setModel</li>
        <li>You can access the view's template directly, through $object->template->set();</li>
        <li>You can define object-level hooks (callbacks)</li>
        <li>It can raise object-specific exceptions, through throw $object->exception('ouch')</li>
        <li>You can remove and destroy an object without rendering: $object->destroy()</li>
        <li>You can manipulate elements such as $object->getElement('foo');</li>
        <li>You can reload an object through AJAX, with $object->js()->reload();</li></ul>

        <p>All that you have seen happening, is due to the power of the AbstractView class. All views in Agile Toolkit are based
        on this class. This means you can add as many as you wish on any page, change their templates, add JavaScript events
        to them, make them interact with other objects and even reload themselves in a very <b>unified</b> way.</p>
