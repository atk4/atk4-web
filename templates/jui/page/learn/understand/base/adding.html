    <h1>Adding objects in Agile Toolkit</h1>

<p>Adding is one of the most powerful concepts in Agile Toolkit. Here is the simplest form of adding:
</p>
<?Code?>
 $new_object = $parent -> add('ClassName');
<?/?>
<p>
There are some rules:
<ul>
<li>All new objects are 'added'. Never use the "new" statement</li>
<li>There is nothing static (such as User::checkPassword()). Always add before using a method.</li>
<li>An object is added into another object. Both objects will become linked.</li>
<li>Each object is assigned a short_name. The short Name is unique within the parent.</li>
<li>Each object has a "name". It's unique in your server.</li>
<li>After you added an object, you can configure it.</li>
<li>There are only 4 arguments for adding. You can't specify more. This is intentional.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arguments of add()</h2>
<p>All arguments of add(), except the first, are optional. When Controllers, Models and Helpers are added, only the first argument is used. Views can use all four arguments.</p>
<?Code?>
 $new_view_object = $parent -> add($class, $short_name, $spot, $template );
<?/?>

<p><b>$parent</b> — must be an existing object. You can only add a View into a View, but you can add a Controller and Model anywhere.</p>
<p><b>$class</b> — the name of the class. There is a convention for naming classes. 'Form_UserDetails' would be an example of a class name.</p>
<p><b>$short_name</b> — overrides the generation of short_name. Always use "null".</p>
<p><b>$spot</b> — defines where rendered version of the View's template will be inserted. You can add multiple objects into the same spot. Existing contents of the spot will be erased when the object is being rendered. Default value is 'Content'.</p>
<p><b>$template</b> — overrides the View's default template. If an array is used, then the first argument is the file name of the template (such as "view/banner"). The second argument is optional and defines which region to use within the template. If not specified "_top" is used, which means the contents of the entire template file will be used. If $template is not an array, but a string, then it specifies a region in the parent's template which will be cloned and used by the view</p>

<h2>init() method</h2>
<p>Anytime you add anything, Agile Toolkit creates an object, and links it with the API and the parent by setting $obj->owner and $obj->api properties. For views it also initializes the template. When it's all done, the init() method is called.</p>
<p>This is true for any object in Agile Toolkit. Therefore, you never need to use object constructors, and should use the init() method instead. There are several important notes:<ul>
<li>init() does not take arguments. Configuration is done through chaining.</li>
<li>add() prepares your object so that you can use it in a reasonable way inside init().</li>
<li>you can add() other objects recursively from inside init().</li>
<li>you must never use "echo" in agile toolkit. Only for debugging.</li>
<li>it's suggested you don't assume anything about your object's parent.</li>
<li>don't do heavy-duty work in init(). There is a chance that your object will be initialized, but not rendered.</li>
<li>always call parent::init(), preferably before you do anything.</li>
</ul>
<?Code?>
class Form_ContactForm extends Form {
    function init(){
        parent::init();

        $this->add('Disclaimer');

        $this->addField('line','name');
        $this->addField('line','surname');
        $this->addSubmit('Send');
    }
}
<?/?>
<h2>Other forms of adding</h2>
<p>There are many wrappers for add() functions. For example, when you add a field to a form, you use addField('line','name'). This function is a wrapper for the normal add(), however it performs extra prepping functions for that type of object. Wrappers for add() start with "add" in most cases. However. there are some functions which do not use this convention, such as js(), exception(), and $grid-&gt;addColumn() (it does not create a new object). In your code, always try to follow the convention, and call a function 'addSomething' if it adds a new object and returns a new object.
</p>
<p>

<h2>Other Examples</h2>
<?Code?>
$admin=$this->add('Model_User')->addCondition('admin',true);
<?/?>
<p>
Adds model to the current object. add() returns an instance of a new object, making it possible for you to chain-call methods of the newly added object.
</p>
<?Code?>
$menu=$this->api->add('Menu',null,'Menu');
<?/?>
<p>
Adds menu inside api, and use a template spot 'Menu' inside the api's template for output.
</p>

<?Code?>
$view=$page->add('View',null,'BusinessInfo','BusinessInfo');
$view->template->set($data);
<?/?>
<p>
The region &lt;?BusinessInfo?&gt; inside the page's template will be replaced by a view. The template chunk, however, will be cloned by the view, so just adding it like this will have no effect on the resulting output. The second line, however, places the contents of an associative $data array into the template of the view.
</p>

<h2>Working with existing objects</h2>
<p><b>$this->hasElement($short_name)</b> return child object if found, or false if not found.</p>
<p><b>$this->getElement($short_name)</b> similar to hasElement() but will produce an exception if not found. Use this when chaining.</p>
<p><b>$this->destroy()</b> remove the current object from its parent. For a view, this will remove it from rendered page.</p>
<p>Properties: <b>$this->name</b> name unique to the system. <b>$this->short_name</b> is a short name. <b>$this->template</b> reference to the SMlite template for the current view. <b>$this->owner</b> reference to the object whose add() was used (the parent). <b>$this->api</b> refers to the API class of the parent object.</p>
