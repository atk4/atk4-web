    <h1>Knowledge Requirements</h1>
    <p>Developing on Agile Toolkit is much much simpler than developing with plain PHP. It makes great sense to skip some
    stuff and get real results quick.</p>

    <p>Agile Toolkit is used to power many high end projects and it does not lack in flexibility or power. Once you start using
    it, it's unlikely that you'll want to mess with things on the low level.</p>

    <p>It turns out that you need to know very little to use Agile Toolkit.</p>

    <h2>Programming in PHP</h2>
    <p>It might sound sad, but PHP is not the best language to learn programming with. You can write the code but seeing
    result and experimenting is quite challenging. Much less straightforward than QBASIC used to be.</p>

    <p>However you would need to know about PHP expressions, variables, control structures logical operators, so <a
    href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php">start reading language reference</a>. You might want to skip features
    which Agile Toolkit specifically does not use (as noted on previous page)</p>

    <h2>Object-Oriented Programming Training</h2>
    <p>Apart from syntax, you need to understand how objects work. Look for some on-line documentation for full information,
    but you would need to understand the difference between Class and Object, how class inheritance works and how you can
    override methods. Some experience in object-oriented development is really beneficent for Agile Toolkit even if you used
    language other than PHP.</p>
