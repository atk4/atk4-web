<h1>Knowledge Requirements</h1>
<p>How much you must know before you start using Agile Toolkit and what will Agile Toolkit teach you?</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit is used to power many high end projects and it does not lack in flexibility or power. Nevertheless, developing 
with Agile Toolkit is much simpler than developing with plain PHP alone. Once you start using Agile Toolkit, it's unlikely that 
you'll want to mess with things on the low level of PHP again. It makes a great deal of sense to skip some low-level stuff
and get real results quick.</p>

<p>I will make one thing clear. Agile Toolkit is aimed at "developers", guys who write application code inside a proper text editor.
If you prefer to use drag-and-drop interface to build your application, Agile Toolkit might not be ideal for you. It is however
a real treat to those who strive for power and control over their software.</p>

<p>Some other frameworks will expect developers to be well familiar with Web Development already. This book nor Agile Toolkit
does not require that. You may be a developer coming from non-web development platform and would still be confident with
Agile Toolkit and be able to grasp it.</p>

<h2>Learn to program</h2>
<p>If you have been "mashing" and only slightly immersed yourself into the development, you will need to be comfortable with it.
I have seen wordpress / drupal developers who did not know how to iterate through an array.</p>

<p>It is a good time to strengthen your core concepts of programming before going forward. If you are coming from a different
programming language, you should quickly check PHP language features before moving on. Look through <a
  href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php">PHP language reference</a> to make sure you become familiar with language
constructs. </p>

<h2>Object-Oriented Programming Training</h2>
<p>Apart from the syntax, you need to understand how objects work. Look for some on-line documentation on Object-Oriented Programming 
for more information. You will need to understand the difference between a Class and an Object, how class inheritance works, and how 
you can override methods. Some experience in object-oriented development is really beneficial when using Agile Toolkit, even if you used
a language other than PHP. If you have developed any desktop application in Java or ObjectiveC, you will feel "at home" with Agile
Toolkit.</p>

<h2>Understanding Performance</h2>
<p>If you think that speed of your application depends on the framework you're choosing then you do not fully understand the
measurement of performance and concepts of scalability. This book will introduce to the theoretical performance and how
use of a toolkit can improve your developer performance with minimum overheads of application performance.</p>

<h2>Guidelines for naming methods</h2>
<p>Apart from what was explained above, there are other guidelines and principles you should follow when creating methods:</p>

<h3>Prefix dynamically-executed methods</h3>

<p>Agile Toolkit uses camelCase method naming. When methods are called dynamically, they should be prefixed with a keyword and an underscore. For example: if you want to add a page into the API, your method would start with "page_".Similarly you would use "page_" for sub-pages, "layout_" for ApiFrontend layouts, and so on.</p>

<h2>Method visibility</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of Agile Toolkit, you will find most of the methods and properties defined as public. This is because some of the controllers require access to those methods and properties, and there is no way to define a "Friendly" class in PHP. Use your common sense when programming. Don't start manually creating objects and adding them into $obj->elements[] just because the elements array is public.</p>
