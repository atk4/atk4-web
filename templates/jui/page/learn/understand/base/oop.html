    <h1>Knowledge Requirements</h1>
    <p>Agile Toolkit is used to power many high end projects and it does not lack in flexibility or power. Nevertheless, developing 
    with Agile Toolkit is much simpler than developing with plain PHP alone. Once you start using Agile Toolkit, it's unlikely that 
    you'll want to mess with things on the low level of PHP again. It makes a great deal of sense to skip some low-level stuff
    and get real results quick.</p>

    <p>It turns out that you need to know very little to use Agile Toolkit.</p>

    <h2>Programming in PHP</h2>
    <p>It might sound sad, but PHP is not the best language with which to learn programming. You can write code easily, but seeing
    the results and experimenting with code can be quite challenging - much more complicated than QBASIC used to be.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, you do need to know about PHP expressions, variables, control structures and logical operators. So if you don't, <a
    href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php">start reading the PHP language reference</a>. You might want to skip the features
    which Agile Toolkit specifically does not use (as noted on the previous page)</p>

    <h2>Object-Oriented Programming Training</h2>
    <p>Apart from the syntax, you need to understand how objects work. Look for some on-line documentation on Object-Oriented Programming 
    for more information. You will need to understand the difference between a Class and an Object, how class inheritance works, and how 
    you can override methods. Some experience in object-oriented development is really beneficial when using Agile Toolkit, even if you used
    a language other than PHP.</p>
