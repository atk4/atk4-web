        <h1>How Agile Toolkit keeps PHP Simple?</h1>
        <p>The PHP language packs an insane amount of features. When all of them are mashed together, your code starts to look complex, creepy and very Java-like. Agile Toolkit specifically tries to avoid some of the features, and tones down some other features.</p>

        <h2>PHP5 Features Agile Toolkit avoids using</h2>
        <p>Below are the list of features and concepts which Agile Toolkit avoids, as well as the reasoning behind the decision:</p>

        <h3>Command-line code generation</h3>
        <p>There is no magic command-line utility to generate a bunch of code on your behalf. Generation of repeated code is a violation
        of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. It also often adds stuff to your project that you are not aware of, but
        which you will need to continue to maintain.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit provides many ways to simplify your project structure and reduce the amount of code you will
        need to write, therefore code generation is not needed.</p>

        <h3>Focus on solution, not on theory</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit was created to get the job done and to get developers paid. Certainly there are many things it can't
        do, such as support every possible flavour of SQL, or add support for Sencha JS. We however believe that focusing
        our limited resources on specific implementations, but giving you many more components to work with, is a much better
        approach.</p>

        <p><i>Note: Currently only MySQL is supported, but support for other database engines will be eventually added.</i></p>

        <h3>Singletons</h3>
        <p>Singletons are evil. Especially in PHP. They give no benefits, not even memory saving. They might have some use in
        Java, but are generally considered a bad design in PHP software.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit never relies on singletons. As a result, you may create two or more instances of API, completely
        independently. "Controllers" can only be added once into the parent, but having them in each copy of the API makes sense.
        Consider the example, where clicking a link in the Admin system logs you into the Frontend as a specific user. The most 
        correct way to implement this is to initialize a Frontend API along with its Auth, and log the user there directly.</p>

        <h3>Protected and Private properties</h3>
        <p>Access restriction is a way to tell users "keep away from the core". Unfortunately PHP does not implement any
        support which would allow specific classes (friendly as in C++ or package as in Java) access to those
        properties.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit keeps properties and functions public. Even though you might not need to call them, some Controller
        may use them directly to enhance functionality of an object in a certain context.</p>

        <h3>Setters and Getters</h3>
        <p>There is a school of thought that all properties should be declared as 'private', and should only be accessible through
        accessor functions such as getMyProperty / setMyProperty. This principle seems to work fine in the C language, which can optimize
        the use of those functions to the same level as accessing the properties directly. In PHP, using this approach slows
        down both the development and execution slightly.</p>

        <p>In Agile Toolkit you will often see the use of $obj->set() and $obj->get() methods, which functionally vary
        depending on the object type. Usually those methods deal with complex logic, such as setting tag values in templates. Do not be
        afraid to access properties directly.</p>

        <p>The exception is in field definitions for Models, which use functions primarily for chaining.</p>

        <h3>Long variable or class names</h3>
        <p>Typing long variable names adds up. Methods, classes and properties in Agile Toolkit use compact names
        to produce as little code as possible</p>

        <h3>Namespaces</h3>
        <p>Starting with PHP5.3, namespaces were introduced to avoid name collision and shorten class names. Agile
        Toolkit would not benefit from any of those two features. Class naming is already short and quite to-the-point.
        </p>
        <p>In Agile Toolkit you can implement class aliasing by extending a class with an empty class. For instance, the 
        Form class extends Basic/Form. If you want to use a 3rd party Form class it would fit into the Agile naming scheme 
        and you could alias it.</p>
        <p>If you are using code which is not built specifically for Agile Toolkit, then namespaces can and should be
        used.</p>

        <p>Finally, namespace definition and dependencies consume quite an amount of space, and require users to
        understand them. Agile Toolkit might add transparent support for Namespaces at some point in the future.</p>

        <h2>Features to be careful about</h2>
        <h3>PHPDoc</h3>
        <p>Adopted from JavaDoc, this is a standard way to document PHP code. Agile Toolkit uses PHPDoc for short comments.
        While PHPDoc supports many @tags which often have lengthy comments, we believe that there are other means to write
        documentation. PHPdocs in Agile Toolkit usually consist of a single-line string, containing useful info and 
        not duplicating meaning already conveyed by the method name itself.</li>

        <h3>XML and Yaml</h3>
        <p>Those languages are used in Java and by some other frameworks to aid in configuration and code generation. Agile
        Toolkit is strictly opposed to extra parsing of different formats. PHP developers usually find XML more complex to 
        understand than native PHP code.</p>

        <h3>IDEs and code type hinting</h3>
        <p>Some of the constructions in Agile Toolkit make it impossible for type hinting to work correctly in IDEs. In some
        instances, a comment suggesting a variable type may be used, for example, with the add() function, which may help
        code hinting to work in the IDE:
<?Code?>
/* @var $form Form */
$form=$page->add('Form');
$f->addFi.. /* completion works */

<?/?>

        <p>PHP is a loosely typed language, and Agile Toolkit takes advantage of that. IDEs were initially designed for
        languages such as C++ or Java and struggle to properly understand PHP. Rely on your common sense and Reference documentation. 
        If you can't give up code completion, you should perhaps look into other programming languages.</p>

        <h3>Interfaces</h3>
        <p>An Interface is a design feature in PHP, by which you can set the requirements for class implementation. While it might have some
        use when designing software architecture, it has little use in Agile Toolkit.</p>  

        <h3>Over-testing</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit lets you write less code. Testing is still important, but Agile Toolkit narrows it down to two types
        of testing. Unit testing is essential to test your business logic. However this type of test is too simple when you need to analyse complex
        interactions, like when testing user interfaces. In this case you need browser-side testing, which uses a different type of 
        testing suite.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit recognizes the importance of tests, however you will be pleased to see that the advanced object
        architecture in Agile Toolkit severely reduces potential problems in presentation logic, and all you need to implement 
        is low-level testing.</p>

        <p>Upgrading to a newer version of Agile Toolkit may slightly affect your UI, but as long as you are using it properly, there will be
        no functional impact.</p>
