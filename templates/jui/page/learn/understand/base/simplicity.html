        <h1>How Agile Toolkit keeps PHP Simple?</h1>
        <p>PHP language packs insane amount of features. When all of them are mashed together, code starts to look complex, creepy and very Java-like. Agile Toolkit specifically tries to avoid some of the features and tone-down some other features.</p>

        <h2>PHP5 Features Agile Toolkit avoids using</h2>
        <p>Below are the list of features and concepts which Agile Toolkit avoids as well as reasoning:</p>

        <h3>Command-line code generation</h3>
        <p>There are no magic command-line utility to generate bunch of code on your behalf. Code generation is the violation
        of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. It also adds stuff into your project, that you are not aware of, but
        would need to continue to maintain.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit relies on many ways to simplify your project structure and reduce amount of code you will
        need to write, therefore code generation is not needed.</p>

        <h3>Focus on solution, not on theory</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit was created to get job done and to get developers paid. Certainly there are many things it can
        do such as support every possible SQL flavor or add support for Sencha JS. We however believe that focusing
        our limited resources on a single implementation, but giving you much more components to work with is much better
        thing to do.</p>

        <p><i>Note: Currently only MySQL is supported. Support for other database engines will be eventually added.</p>

        <h3>Singletons</h3>
        <p>Singletons are evil. Especially in PHP. They give no benefits, not even memory saving. They might have some use in
        Java, but are generally considered a bad design in PHP software.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit never relies on singletons. As a result, you may create 2 or more instances of API, completely
        independent. "Controllers" can only be added once into the parent, but having them in each copy of API makes sense.
        Consider example, where clicking link in Admin system logs you into Frontend as a specific user. The most correct way
        to implement this is to initialize Frontend's API along with it's Auth and log user there directly.</p>

        <h3>Protected and Private properties</h3>
        <p>Access restriction is a way to tell users "keep away from the core". Unfortunately PHP does not implement any
        support which would allow some specific classes (friendly as in C++ or package as in Java) access those
        properties.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit keeps properties an functions public. Even though you might not need to call them, some Controller
        may use them directly to enhance functionality of the object in question.</p>

        <h3>Setters and Getters</h3>
        <p>There exists a belief, that all the properties should be declared as private and should only be accessible through
        unctions such as getMyProperty / setMyProperty. This principle seems to work fine in C language which can optimize
        use of those functions to the same level as using properties directly. In PHP using this approach slightly slows
        down both the development and execution.</p>

        <p>In Agile Toolkit you will often find use of $obj->set() and $obj->get() methods which functionality differ
        depending on object type. Usually those deal with complex logic such as setting tag values in templates. Do not be
        afraid to access properties directly.</p>

        <p>The exception is field definitions in Models, which use functions primarily for chaining.</p>

        <h3>Long variable or class names</h3>
        <p>Typing long variable names adds up. Methods, classes and properties in Agile Toolkit are using compact naming
        to produce as little code as possible</p>

        <h3>Namespaces</h3>
        <p>Starting from PHP5.3 namespaces are being introduced to avoid name collision and shorten class names. Agile
        Toolkit would not benefit from any of those two features. Class naming is already short and quite to-the-point.
        </p>
        <p>Agile Toolkit uses class aliasing though empty extending classes. For instance class Form extends Basic/Form. If
        you are willing to use 3rd party Form class it should fit into Agile naming scheme and then you could alias it.</p>
        <p>If you are using code which is not built specifically for Agile Toolkit, than namespaces can and should be
        used.</p>

        <p>Finally - namespace definition and dependencies consume quite some amount of space and requires users to
        understand them. Agile Toolkit might add transparent support for Namespaces at some point in the future releases.</p>

        <h2>Featutres to be careful about</h2>
        <h3>PHPDoc</h3>
        <p>Adopted from JavaDoc this is a standard way to document PHP code. Agile Toolkit uses PHPDoc for short comments.
        While PHPDoc supports many @tags and often have lengthy comments, we believe that there are other means to write
        documentation. PHPdocs in Agile Toolkit usually consist of a single string, trying to contain useful info and 
        avoid duplicating meaning already conveyed by the method name.</li>

        <h3>XML and Yaml</h3>
        <p>Those languages are used in Java and some other frameworks to aid in configuration and code generation. Agile
        Toolkit is strictly opposing extra parsing of different formats. XML usually is more complex to understand for PHP
        developers than native PHP code.</p>

        <h3>IDEs and code type hinting</h3>
        <p>Some of the constructions in Agile Toolkit make it impossible for type hinting in IDEs. For example a comment
        suggesting variable type should be used with add() function if you want code hinting to work:
<?Code?>
/* @var $form Form */
$form=$page->add('Form');
$f->addFi.. /* completion works */

<?/?>

        <p>PHP is loosely typed language and Agile Toolkit takes advantage of that. IDEs were initially designed for
        languages such as C++ or Java and struggle to properly understand PHP. Relying on your common sense and documentation
        reference. If you can't give up code completion, you should look into other programming languages.</p>

        <h3>Interfaces</h3>
        <p>Interfaces is a design feature of PHP which sets requirement on a class implementation. While it might have some
        use when designing software architecture, it has little use in Agile Toolkit.</p>  

        <h3>Over-testing</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit lets you write less code. Testing is still important, but Agile Toolkit narrows it down to 2 types
        of testing. Unit testing is essential to test your business logic. However it does not work anymore when you are
        building user interfaces. In this case you need to rely on browser-side testing, which is a different suite.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit recognizes importance of tests, however you will be pleased to find that the advanced object
        architecture in Agile Toolkit severely reduces potential problems in presentation logic and all you need to deal with
        is the low-level testing.</p>

        <p>Upgrading to newer Agile Toolkit may slightly affect your UI, but as long as you using it properly, there will be
        no functional impact.</p>
