        <p>Base Class for your Real-Life entities. For use with no-SQL Data Controllers.
        Implements active record. Compatible with most Views.</p>

    <p>Model is a fundamental class in Agile Toolkit which introduces concept of a very basic Active Record mechanism. Models also hold meta-information about your entity fields such as types, captions, validation, etc</p>

    <h4>Goals and Features of Model</h4>
    <?MoreInfo?>Hierarchical Business Model
    <p>Objects in our life are hierarchical. Your database is not. Agile Toolkit models follow your business model and adapt your data-base.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Field Object
    <p>Each field is defined through a "Field" object. Need more meta-information, properties or flexibility? Extend the Field class.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Database, Table, ID
    <p>Models assume that controller is using one database at a time. Inside a database you may have multiple tables (or files). Inside each file
    you will have records identified by "ID" (or key)</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Allow do modify existing Model
    <p>After you create instance of a model, you can define few more fields if you need to.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Multiple Data Controllers
    <p>You may load model through one Data Controller, save will use same controller by default. You can, however, use another controller with same model.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Great Syntax
    <p>Models implement iterators and array access. That means you can access model properties as it would be array and you can traverse through records inside a foreach() loop.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Field names are unique
    <p>You can't have multiple fields with the same name.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Use in View or directly
    <p>Models are great for either direct use or to be used by standard views. Some other controllers will accept models too.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Hooks
    <p>Models use hooks allowing you to control loading / saving events</p>
    <?/?>

    <h4>What DSQL is not?</h4>
    <p>In the spirit of Agile Toolkit — all of it's classes are strictly focused on a one simple task, without trying to do everything. Here are things which Model will not do and why:
    <?MoreInfo?>No code generation
    <p>Model is implemented in under 200 lines of PHP code. It is designed to be common lowest denominator for many views.</p>
    <?/?>
    <?MoreInfo?>No Relations, Dependencies, Conditions or Expressions
    <p>Model is designed to be simple. It does not support RDBMS features.</p>
    <?/?>
    <?MoreInfo?>No emulation of SQL
    <p>Model does not attempt to emulate SQL features such as offsets. That's job of a Controller to implement.</p>
    <?/?>
