<h1>Model-Based Forms</h1>
<p>
In Agile Toolkit models are used to describe business entities. Controllers allow to build integration between Model and View, such as Form.
</p>
<?Code?>
class Model_Employee extends Model_Person {
	function defineFields(){
		parent::defineFields();

		$this->addField('name')
			->mandatory(true);

		$this->addField('days_worked')
			->system(true)
			->datatype('int');

		$this->addField('salary')
			->mandatory(true)
			->datatype('money');

		$this->addField('money_owed')
            ->caption('Owed')
			->calculated(true);
	}

<h2>Building from from Model</h2>
<p>
To use Model functionality you would need to use MVCForm instead of Form. Calling setModel() or setController() will initialize form by adding fields and binding it with the model.
</p>
<p>It's recommended to use setModel(), which will use default controller for integration between Form and Model.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is required to omit some fields from the form, or change field order. This can be done through 2nd argument to setModel.</p>

<h3>Using existing Model</h3>

<p>Instead of specifying name of the model, you can create the model object and specify exstinging model as a first argument.</p>

<p>This time I have added more code to make form more usable and to actually capture saved data and insert them into the database. addCondition() allowed me to modify model on the fly.</p>
