<h4>Adopt in your company</h4>
<p>We love open-source and we love PHP. Unfortunately apart from some software applications, PHP is often not regarded in enterprise as a serious language. We intend to change that by offering a solid platform focused on business needs yet exceedingly efficient, fast and secure.</p>
<p>If your company produces Web software, consider using the Agile Toolkit. If your business environment has some requirements which Agile Toolkit can't meet, please let us know</p>

<h4>Promoting Affero GPL Software</h4>
<p>Affero GPL v3 is a license which makes sure that any software built on it remains open-source. Unlike other web frameworks which allow closed-source development, we would like more and more software to be built on ATK4 as open-source software. released. If your company is build some internal software, and you would not lose anything if was open-source, consider licensing your project with AGPL. Even with commercial software, it may make sense to release an open-source version as part of your product strategy.</p>
